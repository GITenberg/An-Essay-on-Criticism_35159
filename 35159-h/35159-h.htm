<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>John Oldmixon's <em>Essay on Criticism</em>, like his <em>Reflections on Dr.
Swift's Letter to the Earl of Oxford, about the English Tongue</em>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
provides evidence to support Dr. Johnson's description of its author
as a "scribbler for a party," and indicates that Oldmixon must have
been devoted to gathering examples of what appeared to him to be the
good and bad in literature.</p>

<p>The story of the appearance of the <em>Essay on Criticism</em> in 1728
should begin in 1724, when Oldmixon published in one volume his
<em>Critical History of England, Ecclesiastical and Civil</em>. Dr. Zachary
Grey's criticism of this book was answered by Oldmixon in 1725 in
<em>A Review of Dr. Zachary Grey's Defence of our Ancient and Modern
Historians</em>. In 1726 a two-volume edition of the <em>Critical History of
England</em> appeared with the 1725 edition of the <em>Review of Dr. Zachary
Grey's Defence</em> appended to the first volume. In the preface to the
second volume of the <em>Critical History</em> Oldmixon referred to the <em>Essay
on Criticism</em>, stating that it was ready for the press, but that since it
would have made the second volume too large, it would be published
at a later date. The <em>Essay</em>, he stated, was to prepare the public for his
translation of Abbe Bouhours' <em>La Manière De Bien Penser</em>. It was not,
however, until 1728 that the <em>Essay</em> reached the public. Besides appearing
separately, it was appended, in place of the now removed answer to
Dr. Grey, to the "third" edition of the <em>Critical History</em>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is no
reference to the addition of the <em>Essay</em> in the preface to the first volume,
but its appearance and addition is referred to in the preface to the second
volume.</p>

<p>Oldmixon seems to have had more than one purpose for writing the
<em>Essay</em>; one of them is made quite clear in the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>I shall not, in this <em>Essay</em>, enter into the philosophical
Part of Criticism which <em>Corneille</em> complains of, and that
<em>Aristotle</em> and his Commentators have treated of Poetry,
rather as <em>Philosophers</em> than Poets. I shall not attempt to
give Reasons why Thoughts are <em>sublime</em>, <em>noble</em>, <em>delicate</em>,
<em>agreeable</em>, and the like, but content my self with producing
Examples of every Kind of right Thinking, and leave
it to Authors of more Capacity and Leisure, to treat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
Matter <em>à Fond</em>, and teach us to imitate our selves what
we admire in others.</p></blockquote>

<p>The remarks concerning the English need for guidance in "right
thinking" are obviously intended to prepare a public for Oldmixon's
translation of Bouhours' <em>La Manière De Bien Penser</em>. Following the
method of Bouhours, who was in turn following Longinus, Oldmixon
gives examples from English literature of the various divisions of
"right thinking" and, also like Bouhours, he includes specimens of
failures in this art. The bad examples he presents provide ample
evidence that the Essay was also serving a Whig polemical purpose,
for they are drawn from such writers as Clarendon, Pope and, in particular,
Laurence Echard. The tone and nature of Oldmixon's remarks
on Echard, whose History he had already criticized at length in the
second volume of the <em>Critical History</em>, can be seen in this explanation
of his general treatment of that author:</p>

<blockquote><p>I must sincerely acknowledge, that it was not for Want
of Will, that I did not mention what is beautiful in our
Historian, but for Want of Opportunity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oldmixon's remarks on Pope's <em>Homer</em> are sometimes laudatory,
but more often patronizing; the criticism of Pope's <em>Essay on Criticism</em>
is quite pointed:</p>

<blockquote><p>I dare not say any Thing of the last <em>Essay on Criticism</em>
in Verse, but that if any more curious Reader has discovered
in it something new, which is not in Dryden's
<em>Prefaces</em>, <em>Dedications</em>, and his <em>Essay on Dramatick
Poetry</em>, not to mention the <em>French</em> Criticks, I should be
very glad to have the Benefit of the Discovery.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rift between Pope and Oldmixon can perhaps be dated from the
publication by the latter in 1714 of the "Receipt to make a cuckold"
with great apologies for its indecency. Oldmixon continued to tempt
satiric fate in the ensuing years, and one wonders if, when seeking a
substitute for the <em>Dunciad</em> in the "last" <em>Miscellany</em> of 1728, Pope may
not have remembered Oldmixon's announcement in 1726 of his intention
to publish an <em>Essay on Criticism</em> which was to be written after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
the manner of Bouhours. It is not impossible that this was one of many
influences acting upon Pope to organize the "high flights of poetry" he
had been collecting over the years for a Scriblerian project. Oldmixon
appears, with Gildon and Dennis, among the porpoises in Chapter VI of
<em>Peri Bathous</em>, and the presentation of some of the material in the
<em>Bathous</em>, although more directly indebted to Longinus, does bring Oldmixon's
<em>Essay</em> to mind.</p>

<p>It would seem that Oldmixon felt that more than the porpoises referred
to him, for in his translation and adaptation of Bouhours' <em>La
Manière De Bien Penser</em>, which he published under the title of <em>The
Arts of Logic and Rhetorick</em> later in 1728, the references to Pope are
much harsher, and Swift also comes under more pointed attack.
<em>Gulliver's Travels</em>, <em>A Tale of A Tub</em> (already censured by Oldmixon
in his <em>Reflections on Dr. Swift's Letter</em>), the <em>Essay on Criticism</em>,
<em>Windsor Forest</em> and the <em>Homer</em> are the objects of bitter criticism. In
the concluding pages of <em>The Arts of Logic and Rhetorick</em> Oldmixon
wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>This delicate Author [Pope] has written a <em>rhiming
Essay on Criticism</em>, and made himself merry with his
Brethren in a notable Treatise call'd the <em>Art of Sinking</em>,
to which he and his Partner S&mdash;&mdash;t, have contributed,
more than all the rest of their contemporary writers, if
<em>Trifling</em> and <em>Grimace</em> are not in the high Parts of Writing....
What a Precipice is it from Locke's Human Understanding
to Swift's Lilliput and Profundity!... there
might have been Hopes of rising again; but we sink now
like Ships laden with Lead, and must despair of ever recovering
the Height from which we have fallen.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As we move from Oldmixon's <em>Essay on Criticism</em> to Pope's <em>Peri
Bathous</em> and on to <em>The Arts of Logic and Rhetorick</em>, we perhaps hear
the stretching of the spring on a trap, that snapped in the 1735 edition
of the <em>Dunciad</em>, in which Oldmixon replaced Dennis as the "Senior"
diver "Who but to sink the deeper, rose the higher."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The <em>Essay on Criticism</em> is, however, more than an example of the
inter-relation of literature and politics in the eighteenth century; and
it is more than a step on the way to its author's immortalizing in lead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
It presents, albeit not very imaginatively, a statement of many of the
literary theories and attitudes of the Augustan period. However brief
and incomplete, the remarks about the language of poetry and upon the
effects of certain literary passages are of interest as imperfect exercises
in a type of practical criticism. The material used by Oldmixon
and the literary references he makes indicate, as do many of his other
writings, that, although he was a "scribbler for a party," he was a man
of some literary sense, taste and intelligence.</p>

<h3><em>Design, Thought, and Expression,<br />
in Prose and Verse</em>.</h3>

<p>I am very far from any Conceit of my
own Ability, to treat of so nice a
Subject as this, in a Manner worthy
of it; but having frequently observed
what Errors have been committed by
both Writers and Readers for want
of a right Judgement, I could not
help collecting some loose Hints I
had by me, and putting them into a
little Form, to shew rather what I would do than what
I can do; and to excite some happier Genius, to give
us better Lights than we have hitherto been led by,
which is said with great Sincerity, and without the least
Mixture of Vanity or Affectation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>I
shall not, in this <em>Essay</em>, enter into the philosophical
Part of Criticism which <em>Corneille</em> complains of, and that
<em>Aristotle</em> and his Commentators have treated of Poetry,
rather as <em>Philosophers</em> than <em>Poets</em>. I shall not attempt to
give Reasons why Thoughts are <em>sublime</em>, <em>noble</em>, <em>delicate</em>,
<em>agreeable</em>, and the like, but content my self with producing
Examples of every Kind of right Thinking, and
leave it to Authors of more Capacity and Leisure, to
treat the Matter a <em>Fond</em>, and teach us to imitate our
selves what we admire in others.</p>

<p><em>Aristotle</em>, <em>Horace</em>, <em>Bossu</em>, <em>Boileau</em>, <em>Dacier</em>, and several
other Criticks, have directed us right in the Rules of
Epick and Dramatick Poetry, and <em>Rapin</em> has done the
same as to <em>History</em>, and other Parts of polite Learning.
Several Attempts have been made in <em>England</em> to instruct
us, as well as the <em>French</em> have been instructed;
but far from striking out any new Lights, our <em>Essays</em>
are infinitely short of the Criticisms of our Neighbours.
They teach us nothing which is not to be found there,
and give us what they take thence curtailed and imperfect.
'Tis true, they have drest up their Rules in Verse,
and have succeeded in it very well. There is something
so just and beautiful in my Lord <em>Roscommon</em>'s Essay and
Translation of <em>Horace</em>'s <em>Ars Poetica</em>, as excels any Thing
in <em>French</em> within the like Compass. I have read the
late Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>'s Essay very often, but I don't
think it such a perfect Piece as <em>Dryden</em> represents it, in
his long and tedious Dedication to that noble Lord before
the <em>Æneis</em>. There are many Things very well
thought in it, and they do not seem to be much the
better for the Poetry; which is so prosaick, that if the
Rhimes were pared away, it would be reduced to downright
Prose. Indeed <em>Horace</em>'s Epistle to the <em>Piso's</em> is
not much more poetick; and I do not think, that the
modern Criticks, like the Oracles of Old, give the
greater Sanction to their Rules, for that they are
put into Rhime.</p>

<p>I dare not say any Thing of the last <em>Essay</em> on <em>Criticism</em>
in Verse, but that if any more curious Reader
has discovered in it something new, which is not in
<em>Dryden</em>'s <em>Prefaces</em>, <em>Dedications</em>, and his <em>Essay</em> on <em>Dramatick
Poetry</em>, not to mention the <em>French</em> Criticks, I
should be very glad to have the Benefit of the Discovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>I was strangely surprised to meet with such a Passage,
as what follows, in the Writings of so good an Author
as Sir <em>Robert Howard</em>. <em>Preface</em> to Duke of <em>Lerma</em>:
"In the Difference of Tragedy and Comedy, there
can be no Determination but by the <em>Taste</em>; and whoever
would endeavour to like or dislike by the Rules
of others, he will be as unsuccessful as if he should try
to be perswaded into a Power of believing, not what
he must, but what others direct him to believe."</p>

<p>Thus are <em>Aristotle</em>, <em>Horace</em>, and all that have commented
on them; thus are <em>Boileau</em>, the Lord <em>Roscommon</em>,
the Duke of <em>Bucks</em>, and all the modern Criticks,
confounded with a Word or two, and the Rules of
Writing rendered useless and ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Rules laid down by those great Criticks are not
to be valu'd, because they are given by <em>Aristotle</em>, <em>Horace</em>,
&amp;c. but because they are in Nature and in Truth. <em>Homer</em>,
<em>Sophocles</em>, and <em>Euripides</em>, wrote before <em>Aristotle</em>, and
the Observations he made upon their Poems, were to
shew us how they succeeded by a happy Imitation of
Nature, and without such Imitation there can be no
Poetry; but according to Sir <em>Robert Howard</em>'s Assertion,
that only which a Man likes is good; and if you are
pleas'd with seeing or hearing any Thing unnatural or
even monstruous,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Woman's Head joyn'd to a Fishes Tail;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it is preferable to what is just and true, to the <em>Venus</em> of
<em>Medicis</em>, or the most perfect <em>Madonna</em> in <em>Italy</em>. Thus a
wrong Taste is as good as a right one, and the Smell
of a Pole-cat to be preferr'd to that of a <em>Civet</em>, if a
Man's Nose is so irregular. After this Rate, there never
was a Poet who could write up to the <em>Frenchman</em>'s
Ladder-dance, or <em>Rich</em>'s Harlequin; and whereas Sir
<em>Robert</em> says, we may as well believe, because others do,
as judge, because <em>Aristotle</em>, <em>Horace</em>, &amp;c. do, there is no
Agreement in the Proposition, or it is not rightly stated;
for we do not judge so because <em>Aristotle</em> and <em>Horace</em> did so
judge; but because it is in Nature and in Truth, and they
first shew'd us the Way to find it out.</p>

<p>Criticism is so far from being well understood by us
<em>Englishmen</em>, that it is generally mistaken to be an Effect
of Envy, Jealousy, and Spleen; an invidious Desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
find Faults only to discredit the Author, and build a Reputation
on the Ruin of his.</p>

<p>One has great Reason to think so, when the Critick
looks only on one Side; when he hunts after little Slips
and Negligences, and will not, or cannot see, what is
beautiful and praise-worthy. If an historical or poetical
Performance can no sooner acquire Applause, than he falls
upon it without Mercy, neglects every Thing commendable
in it, and skims off the Filth that rises on the Top of
it; one may be sure his Jealousy is piqu'd, and he is
alarm'd for fear every Encrease of Honour to another
should be a Diminution of his own Glory; such Sort of
Criticism is easily learnt. A Wen or Mole in the Face is
sooner perceiv'd than the Harmony of Features, and the
fine Proportion of Beauty; or, as <em>Dryden</em> says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Errours like Straws upon the Surface flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who would search for Pearls must dive below.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Thought is borrow'd from the Lord <em>Bacon</em>; who,
speaking of Notions and Inferences what may be applied
to Families, says, <span class="quotation">Time is like a River in which Metals
and solid Substances sink, while Chaff and Straw swim on
the Surface</span>. Such borrowing as <em>Dryden</em>'s is highly commendable;
he has paid back what he borrowed with Interest,
and it can by no Means deserve the Scandal of
<em>Plagiarism</em>. I cannot doubt, but Mr. <em>Addison</em> in the
sublime Thought, where he represents the Duke of <em>Marlborough</em>
in the Heat of the War:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rides in the Whirlwind, and directs the Storm;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>did nor forget these two Lines of <em>Boileau</em> to the King:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Serene himself the stormy War he guides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the Battle like a God presides.<br /></span>

<p>I shall all along, through this Discourse, take the Liberty
to pass from one Subject to another as the Hint offers,
without any Method, according to the Freedom of <em>Essays</em>.
Mr. <em>Dryden</em> excuses this Freedom, by the Example of
<em>Horace</em>'s Epistle to the <em>Piso's</em>, which is immethodical and
I must excuse my self by Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s&mdash;</p>

<p>The Taste and Appetite of these straw Criticks, may
justly be compar'd to Ravens and Crows, who neglecting
clean Food, are always searching after Carrion.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><em>Horace</em>'s
Rule is very well worth observing, when we are
about to give Judgement on a Poem or History, where
the <em>Will</em> is not concern'd:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Ubi plura nitent in Carmine non ego paucis</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Offendor maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Aut humana parum cavit natura.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in a Poem most are shining Thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm not offended if I find some Fau'ts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as are Slips of Negligence, or where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Poet may through humane Frailty erre.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As it is much easier to discern Blemishes than Beauties,
so is it to censure than to commend, as the Duke of
<em>Buckingham</em> tells us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet whatsoe'er is by vain Criticks thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praising is harder much than finding Fau't:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In homely Pieces ev'n the <em>Dutch</em> excel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Italians</em> only can draw Beauty well.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such Criticks need not be in Pain, if a Poem or History
makes its Way in the World a little; if it is not good,
it will lose Ground of it self faster than it got it. If imperfect
Pieces have gain'd Credit, and kept it for some
Time, it was not for what was bad in them, but what, if
not really good, was at least agreeable. <em>Dryden</em>'s Translation
of <em>Virgil</em> was generally liked for the Diction and Versification,
though it was dislik'd on Account of Equality
and Truth; and to have made a <em>Critick</em> upon it, as <em>Milbourn</em>
did, without doing justice to his Numbers and Language,
shew'd the Spirit of the Man was more engaged
in it than his Judgement. All Criticisms on <em>Dryden</em>'s
Language and Numbers are in Defiance of <em>Horace</em>'s Rule
above-mention'd, because there is no Body but knows
that it was impossible for <em>Dryden</em> to make an ill Verse,
or to want an apt and musical Word, if he took the least
Care about it. I could very easily mark out a thousand
Slips and Negligences of that Kind in his <em>Virgil</em>; yet for
all that, there are more good Verses in that Translation
than in any other, if Mr. <em>Pope</em>'s <em>Homer</em> is not to be excepted.</p>

<p>It has been often said by very good Judges, that <em>Cato</em>
was no proper Subject for a Dramatick Poem: That the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Character of a Cynick Philosopher, is very inconsistent
with the Hurry and Tumult of Action and Passion, which
are the Soul of Tragedy. That the ingenious Author
miscarried in the Plan of his Work, but supported it by
the Dignity, the Purity, the Beauty, and the Justness of
the Sentiments and the Diction.</p>

<p>This was so much the Opinion of Mr. <em>Maynwaring</em>, who
was generally allow'd to be the best Critick of our Time, that
he was against bringing the Play upon the Stage, and
it lay by unfinish'd many Years. Mr. <em>Maynwaring</em> highly
approv'd of the Sentiments and the Diction, but did
not fall in with the Design. That it was play'd at last
was owing to Mr. <em>Hughes</em>, who wrote the <em>Siege of Damascus</em>,
a Tragedy. He had read the Four Acts, which
were finished, and rightly thought it would be of Service
to the Publick, to have it represented at the latter End of
Queen <em>Ann</em>'s Reign, when the old <em>English</em> Spirit of Liberty
was as likely to be lost as it had ever been since the
Conquest. He endeavour'd to bring Mr. <em>Addison</em> into
his Opinion, which he did so far as to procure his Consent,
that it should be acted if Mr. <em>Hughes</em> would write
the last Act, and he offer'd him the Scenary for his Assistance,
excusing his not finishing it himself on Account
of some other Avocations. He prest Mr. <em>Hughes</em> to do
it so earnestly, that he was prevail'd upon and set about it.
But a Week after, seeing Mr. <em>Addison</em> again with an Intention
to communicate to him what he had thought of it,
he was agreeably surpris'd at his producing some Papers,
where near half of the Act was written by the Author
himself, who took Fire at the Hint that it would be serviceable,
and upon a second Reflection went thorough
with the Fifth Act: Not that he was diffident of Mr.
<em>Hughes</em>'s Ability, but knowing that no Man could have
so perfect a Notion of his Design as himself, who had
been so long and so carefully thinking of it. I was told
this by Mr. <em>Hughes</em>, and I tell it to shew that it was not for
the <em>Love</em> Scenes, that Mr. <em>Addison</em> consented to have his
Tragedy acted, but to support the old <em>Roman</em> and <em>English</em>
Publick Spirit, which was then so near being suppressed
by Faction and Bigotry. The most cunning of their
Leaders were sensible of it, and therefore very dexterously
stole away the Merit of the Poem, by applauding the
Poet, and patronizing the Action and Actors. It is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>fore
obvious, that a severe Critick may find a Colour for
his Severity, with Respect to the <em>Design</em> of the Play, but
that will not hinder its captivating every one that sees or
reads it. The Graces and Excellencies, both of Thought
and Expression, do much more deserve our Admiration
and Applause, than the Deficiency in the Fable deserves
Censure. However, as to <em>Dryden</em>'s <em>Virgil</em> and <em>Cato</em>, ask
those that admire the one or the other what it is that
pleases them? And I doubt it will be found to be the
very Places, which should have most displeased, where
<em>Dryden</em> offended most against the Character of Epick
Poetry by imitating <em>Ovid</em>'s Softness, and an eternal <em>Jeu
des Mots</em>, <em>Playing upon Words</em>, and where <em>Cato</em> suspends
the Action and Passion of the Scene to teach the Audience,
Philosophy and Morality.</p>

<p>It is common for the most discreet and delicate Authors
to take Care of themselves, when they are treating
of any of the Sciences. You will always find the Divine,
the Lawyer, the Mathematician, the Astrologer, the
Chymist, the Mechanick, <em>&amp;c.</em> reserving to themselves
the Merit of their particular Sciences when they are discoursing
of the Arts in general. A merry Instance of this
in the <em>Astrologer</em> is mention'd by the very learned <em>Gregory</em>
out of <em>Albumazer</em>, who asserted, that all Religions
were govern'd by the Planets; the <em>Mahometan</em> by <em>Venus</em>,
the <em>Jewish</em> by <em>Saturn</em>, and the <em>Christian</em> by the <em>Sun</em>:
Nay, he adds, that one <em>Guido Bonatus</em> a <em>Gymnosophist</em>
affirms in his Parallells, that <span class="quotation">Christ himself was an Astrologer,
and made use of Elections</span>. The <em>Spectator</em>, with
all his Modesty, has discover'd something of this Self-love
in that of the Sciences, and could not help giving
into this Infirmity. Every one knows what a fine Talent
he had for Writing, and particularly how beautiful his
Imagination was, and how polite his Language. Himself
was not a Stranger to it; and we therefore read in
the <em>Spectator</em>, N<sup>o</sup> 291; <span class="quotation">I might further observe, that there
is not a <em>Greek</em> or <em>Latin</em> Critick, who has not shewn, even
in the Stile of his Criticisms, that he was Master of all
the Elegance and Delicacy of his native Language</span>. Here
does this excellent Author forbid any one's Claim to the
Character of a Critick, who is not like himself Master
of the Delicacy and Elegance of his native Tongue;
though I am apt to believe, that as a Man may be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
very good Judge of Painting without being himself a
Painter, so he may make very good Criticisms in Poetry
and Eloquence, without being a Poet or an Orator. What
would have become of our famous Critick <em>Rymer</em>, whom
Mr. <em>Dryden</em> has so much commended, and so much
abused, if his Criticisms must not pass, on Account of his
not being Master of the Elegance and Delicacy of our
Language, as it does not appear he was by his Translation
of <span class="spread"><span class="smcap">Ovid</span></span>'s Epistle from <em>Penelope</em> to <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here skulk'd <em>Ulysses</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Sword how <em>Dolon</em> no nor <em>Rhesus</em> 'scap'd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For thee I ask and ask them o'er and o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps to her your dowdy Wife define<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cares no more, so that her Cupboard shine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who revel in your House without Controul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eat and waste your Means our Blood and Soul.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <em>Bantring</em> and <em>Napping</em>, the <em>Skipper</em>, the <em>Dowdy
Wife</em>, the <em>Cupboard</em>, the <em>Means</em>, and the <em>Blood</em> and <em>Soul</em>,
agree admirably with the Royal Characters of King
<em>Ulysses</em> and Queen <em>Penelope</em>, and the courtly Manner of
<em>Ovid</em>. <em>Radcliff</em>'s Letter, from the Skipper's Wife of <em>Newcastle</em>
to her Husband at <em>St. Catherine</em>'s, can hardly have
more of the Burlesque in it.</p>

<p>The Truth is, Mr. <em>Addison</em>, in the above Quotation,
has a Fling upon the Author of the Critick upon his <em>Cato</em>.
<span class="quotation">A few general Rules extracted out of the <em>French</em> Authors,
with a certain Cant of Words, have sometimes set up an illiterate
heavy Writer, for a most judicious and formidable Critick.</span>
I know no Instance wherein that Gentleman loses his
Temper so much as in this. There were but three Authors
in our Time who were <em>Criticks</em> by Profession, <em>Rymer</em>,
<em>Dennis</em>, and <em>Gildon</em>. <em>Rymer</em> is own'd by himself to be
a masterly Critick: He himself knew Mr. <em>Dennis</em> did not
want Learning; and as to Fire, he has perhaps rather
too much of it, than too little. I can't help thinking,
that the Ode he writ on <em>Dryden</em>'s Translation of the 3d
Book of the <em>Georgicks</em>, in <em>Tonson</em>'s Fourth Miscellany, deserv'd
a kinder Word than illiterate or heavy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9"><span class="smcap"><em>Stanza II.</em></span><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Passage, taken out of the <em>Spectator</em>, could not
relate to <em>Gildon</em>, because of the <em>French</em> Cant, which he
did not affect, nor understand. It is plain therefore, it
must refer to the Critick upon <em>Cato</em>; which shews us,
that as conscious as the most modest Man may be of his
own Insufficiency; yet, when it is in Dispute, he cannot
always preserve his Insensibility. <em>Cato</em> is a very good <em>Dramatick</em>
Poem, and so was the <em>Cid</em>; yet the best <em>Critick</em>
that ever was written in <em>French</em>, was that upon the <em>Cid</em>,
as <em>La Bruyere</em> observes.</p>

<p>In another of the <em>Spectators</em>, we meet with something
which proves to us, that a Man may have as much Modesty
as Mr. <em>Addison</em>; and yet be very jealous of losing any Part
of the Glory which is due to him. Every one knows,
that though he was a Master of Eloquence, he never attempted
to speak in Parliament, but it was with some
Confusion; and what he said, did not answer the Expectation
which had been raised by the Character of his
Writings. Himself takes notice of this, not as an Infirmity,
but as the Effect of Caution and Art. <em>Spectator</em>,
N<sup>o</sup> 231, Cicero tells us, that he never liked an Orator,
<span class="quotation">who did not appear in some little Confusion at the Beginning
of his Speech; and confesses, that he himself never
entered upon an Oration without Trembling and Concern.
It is indeed a Kind of Deference which is due to a great
Assembly. The bravest Man often appears timorous upon
these Occasions, as we may observe that there is generally
no Creature more impudent than a Coward.</span> I hope I shall
not be thought invidious, or to endeavour to lessen the
Veneration, which all, who love polite Learning, owe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Memory of the <em>Spectator</em>; yet I could not but take
notice, how sensible the most Discreet are in Point of Rivalship
in Fame. What else can one think of the <em>Spectator</em>'s
Saying in the Dedication of the Eighth Volume:
<span class="quotation">I need not tell you, that the free and disengaged Behaviour
of a fine Gentleman, makes as many aukward <em>Beaux</em>, as
the Easiness of your Favourite <em>Waller</em> hath made insipid
Poets.</span> Though the <em>fine Gentleman</em> may be applied to
Mr. <em>Waller</em>, and the <em>aukward Beaux</em> to the insipid Poets;
yet the Comparison cannot hold, without doing an Injury
to Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s Merit. The <em>Beaux</em> may be aukward, by
imitating what you call a <em>fine Gentleman</em>, who is generally
distinguish'd by some Affectation; but no Poet can
be insipid by imitating Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s Easiness, if he has
any Portion of his Wit and Gallantry. The <em>Spectator</em>'s
Manner was not very different from Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s, as to
Easiness; and I have as often heard it wished, that there
was more Fire in his own Poetry, as that there was more
in Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s. Two of the politest Authors in <em>Europe</em>,
of the last Age, St. <em>Evremont</em> and <em>La Fontaine</em>, had
such an Esteem for Mr. <em>Waller</em>, that it is strange he meets
with no better Quarter at Home. Those two famous
<em>French</em> Wits us'd to call him another <em>Anacreon</em>; and the
Criticks have not yet complained, that ever <em>Anacreon</em>
taught any Poet to be insipid. Mr. <em>Addison</em> is so far from
thinking that <em>Waller</em> had any such Infection about him,
that he wishes he had lived to have sung in Praise of
King <em>William</em>, the sublimest Subject that ever was offered
to a Muse, by how much the Deliverer of Nations from
Slavery is a more godlike Character, than to have subjected
and enslaved them, as did <em>Alexander</em> and <em>Cæsar</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Courtly <em>Waller</em> next commands my Lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muse, tune thy Verse with Art to <em>Waller</em>'s Praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While tender Airs, and lovely Dames inspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft melting Thoughts, and propagate Desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long shall <em>Waller</em>'s Strains our Passion move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <em>Sacharissa</em>'s Beauties kindle Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Verse, harmonious Bard, and flatt'ring Song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can make the Vanquish'd great, the Coward strong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Verse can shew ev'n <em>Cromwell</em>'s Innocence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And complement the Storms that bore him hence.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! had thy Muse not come an Age too soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seen great <em>Nassau</em> on the <em>British</em> Throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How had his Triumphs glitter'd in thy Page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm'd thee to a more exalted Rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Scenes of Death, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So little Danger is there of learning to be insipid by
imitating <em>Waller</em>, that he is praised by the Editor of
St. <em>Evremond</em>'s Works, for the Elevation of his Genius,
Mr. <em>Edmond Waller; s'est generallement fait admirer par
l'Elevation de son Esprit</em>.</p>

<p>I do not in this <em>Essay</em> aim at any Thing more, than, as
I have said before, to put several critical Hints, which I
had collected, together, and not to form a regular Discourse,
but take them as they come in my way.</p>

<p>If the <em>Spectator</em>, by the Passage above-mentioned, insinuates
that a Man must be able to perform himself in
an Art, to be a good Judge of the Performances of others;
consequently, that I ought to be a masterly Historian, to
make Remarks on Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s History, he divests me at
once of the Right I pretend to in the following Treatise.
Let us therefore enquire into the Reason of this Reflection.</p>

<p><em>Horace</em>, whom no <em>English</em> Author could understand better
than the <em>Spectator</em>, as appears by his admirable Translation,
teaches us otherwise,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Munus &amp; Officium, nil scribens ipse, docebo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Yet without writing, I may teach to write.</em><br /></span>
<span class="i22"><em>[</em>Rosc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><em>Dacier</em>'s Notes upon <em>Hippocrates</em>, as I have been informed
by my worthy Friend Dr. <em>Allen</em>, are much
better than any others, though made by Men of the <em>Faculty</em>,
which <em>Dacier</em> did not profess. Monsieur <em>Corneille</em>,
the greatest Genius in <em>France</em> for Tragedy, wrote <em>Examens</em>
of his Pieces, which, like <em>Dryden</em>'s Prefaces, were
adapted to the several Tragedies, and very often clashed
with one another, as the Subject required: but because
he would prevent as much as possible any Attack of Criticism,
he declares in one of his Discourses, <span class="quotation">That the
Knowledge which is acquired by Study and Speculation, is
of little or no Use without Experience</span>. Thus an Author
must produce a Tragedy himself, before he presumes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
criticise on another's. If it be the same Thing in History
too, I began at the wrong End, and should have written
three or four Folio Histories, before I had presum'd
to make Remarks on Archdeacon <em>Echard</em>'s, this would
bear very hard upon me, and I must beg Leave to enquire
a little whether the Case be really so or not.</p>

<p>Monsieur <em>Dacier</em> is so far from being of <em>Corneille</em>'s Opinion,
that he thinks a Man who never did write a Tragedy,
may criticise on another's Poem the better for that
he never wrote himself. <span class="quotation">Nay, I do not know</span>, says he in his
Preface to <em>Aristotle</em>, <span class="quotation">whether he who has written Dramatick
poems, is so proper to explain the Rules of the Art,
as he, who never wrote any: For it would be a Miracle if
the former were not seduced by Self-love; whereas the latter
is disinterested, and the more likely to be an impartial
Judge.</span> Again, <span class="quotation">if it was necessary to be a good poet to
make Criticisms on Poetry, we should never have had any
Critick at all; for I do not know one Critick upon Poetry,
that was himself a Poet.</span> By this one would think, that
he did not look upon <em>Rapin</em> as a Critick in Poetry, for he
wrote a Poem on <em>Gardening</em>. <em>Menage</em> makes as little of
him as <em>Dacier</em>; yet <em>Dryden</em> says, were all the Writings of
other Criticks lost, <em>Rapin</em>'s Works alone would be sufficient
to teach us the whole Art of Criticism. We all know <em>Aristotle</em>
and <em>Horace</em> wrote upon Epick Poetry and Tragedy,
yet neither of them ever wrote a Tragedy or Epick Poem;
and perhaps neither of them would have succeeded if he
had. <em>Rymer</em> made one poor Attempt that Way in his
<em>Edgar</em>: But, as if it had been written only to prove that a
Man may judge well of an Art, without being a Performer,
like an ill-built Ship, it sunk in the very launching,
and seem'd to be written only to be damned.</p>

<p>The <em>Guardian</em> seconds the <em>Spectator</em>, and forbids any
one to criticise, that cannot write to Perfection. <span class="quotation">If I find
by his own Manner of Writing, that he is heavy and tasteless,
I throw aside his Criticisms with a secret Indignation,
to see a Man without Genius or Politeness, dictating to the
World on Subjects which I find are above his Reach.</span> Thus
Mr. <em>Rymer</em>, the best Critick we had till then, and all
his Rules, are void and of no Effect; He has cancelled
them with a Dash of his Pen. If a Man must not only
have Politeness, but a Genius, what will become of <em>Aristotle</em>
and <em>Longinus</em>, <em>Bossu</em> and <em>Dacier</em>? They were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
polite Writers, but have not discover'd that they had Genius.
I ever had as little Opinion of heavy tasteless Criticks
as the <em>Spectator</em> or <em>Guardian</em>, yet I never could endure
an arbitrary Judgement; for, what else is <em>tasteless</em> and
<em>heavy</em> without Proof? But then, that Proof could not be
produced without the <em>Criticisms</em>, which, let them be ever
so poor, are often more easily despis'd than answer'd.</p>

<p>I was always convinced by Example, that a Critick may
have a just Taste, without being a Poet; and that the Indignation
the <em>Guardian</em> speaks of, is never provoked, unless
a weak Place is hit upon: As, in the low Phrase,
<span class="quotation">A galled Horse winces when you touch the Sore</span>. In three
or four Lines, we have <em>tasteless</em>, <em>heavy</em>, <em>dogmatical</em>, <em>stupid</em>
Macer <em>and</em> Mundungus all of the poor Criticks. Had
they been really such stupid Creatures, they could not have
given such Offence. Hard Words shew Anger more than
Indignation, and we are apt to conjecture, that the Poets
would not be so angry with the Criticks, if they were not
afraid of them. The Concern of the former is wonderfully
generous; they are not in Pain for what the Criticks
say of their Errours and Failings, but for the Heaviness
and Stupidity of their Criticisms. Thus in the lowest
Life, we shall often hear one angry Woman cry out of
another, <span class="quotation">I do not matter what she said of me, but to see
the Impudence of the Slut</span>. <em>Macer</em> and <em>Mundungus</em> are
taken from Mr. <em>Congreve</em>'s Epistle to Sir <em>Richard Temple</em>;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So <em>Macer</em> and <em>Mundungus</em> school the Times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And write in rugged Verse the softer Rules of Rhimes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the <em>Guardian</em> had the Critick upon <em>Cato</em> in his
Thoughts, when he quoted those Verses, which I suppose
he had, why does he mention rhiming Criticisms?
That Author wrote his Rules and Remarks always in
Prose, so did <em>Rymer</em>; what then do they all mean by
<em>rugged Verse</em>? The Lord <em>Roscommon</em>'s Poetry is Harmony
it self. The last Essay upon Criticism in Verse was not
then written. There remains only the late Duke of
<em>Buckingham</em>'s Poetical Essay, of Note enough to be remembered
by Mr. <em>Congreve</em>: That could not be named,
without offending <em>good Breeding</em>, a Term very often made
use of by two elegant Authors; who, I much question,
had never the Education of a Dancing-Master. However,
Poetry and Criticism are perfect Levellers, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Man can plead Privilege in the Court of <em>Parnassus</em>; what
then is the Meaning of the next Lines after <em>Mundungus</em>?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well do they play the careful Critick's Part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instructing doubly by their matchless Art:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rules for good Verse they first with Pains indite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shew us what are bad by what they write.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Spectator</em> would not do the Poets
the Honour to name them; but we know who are the
Criticks which are <em>thrown aside</em> by them; for no Body
but Mr. <em>D&mdash;&mdash;</em> and Mr. <em>G&mdash;&mdash;</em> made Remarks upon
their Writings, and both of them did. I do not say with
that Politeness and Elegance, which the <em>Spectator</em> and
<em>Guardian</em> have laid down, as the sole Characteristicks of
good Talk and Judgement; though one may almost as
well say, that a Man cannot have good Sense and Wit,
without good Cloaths and a genteel Air. I must needs
own, that I think most of their Criticisms very just,
though had they been still juster than they are, I would
not nave been the Author of them, without taking Notice
of Beauties, as well as finding of Faults, there being
much more Room for the former than the latter.</p>

<p>It is very plain, the <em>Spectator</em> highly stomached the Remarks
which were made on his Writings, and is not very
candid in his Reasoning, to render his Opponents contemptible,
which was the surest Way of disarming them.
<span class="quotation">These Criticks fall upon a Play, not because it is ill written,
but because it takes</span>: This is not the whole Truth.
It is not because it <em>takes</em>, but because it takes for those
very Things which should have damned it <em>Durfey</em>'s
<em>Boarding-School</em>, and his <em>Marriage-Hater match'd</em>, took
with a Vengeance, though the two greatest Pieces of Wit
in them, were <em>Miss's Bread and Butter</em>, and <em>Mynheer's
Muff</em>. <em>Settle</em>'s Tragedies took for the Noise, the Show,
and the Rhime. No Play, that was not supported by
poetical or political Party, which most <em>taking</em> Plays have
been, ever took more than <em>Settle</em>'s <em>Heir of Morocco</em>, in
which there is not one good Thought or Expression.
Again, <span class="quotation">several of these Criticks have laid it down as a
Maxim, that whatever Dramatick Poem has a long Run,
must of Necessity be good for nothing</span>, which is a Misre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>presentation.
The <em>Orphan</em>, <em>Venice Preserv'd</em>, <em>Tamerlane</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> had <em>long Runs</em>, and <em>run</em> still; yet no Critick
has dared to say they did not deserve it: But whoever
will owe his Reputation to <em>taking</em> only, must be contented
to roll with <em>Settle</em>, <em>Durfey</em>, and many other Poets, that <em>took</em>
in their Turn. Could any thing be more monstrous, than
to determine the Merit of <em>Nixon's Prophecy</em>, and the
<em>Spectator</em>, by the Run of the Papers. The former, a
Maggot given to the Rabble, bore more Editions in Ten
Weeks, than the latter has done in Ten Years.</p>

<p>I would not be understood in this, or any thing else, to
endeavour to lessen the Opinion the People have generally
and justly of the <em>Spectator</em>'s Perfections: I verily believe,
there is no Production of the Mind, ancient or modern,
where are to be found more Wit, Politeness, fine Raillery,
good Sense, Learning, and Eloquence; but what I
have said, is to shew, that great Wits as well as little have
their Passions, their Piques and Prejudices, when the least
Blemish is discovered in their Glory. In the same <em>Spectator</em>,
we have another Hint, that no Body ought to criticise
on that Author's Writings, unless he could write as elegantly
as himself, which effectually cuts off all <em>Criticism</em>.
These <span class="quotation">professed Criticks cannot put ten Words together with
Elegance, or common Propriety</span>. What an arbitrary Way
of arguing is this? These Criticks are Smatterers; <span class="quotation">They
vilify only the Productions that gain Applause; the Blemishes
they descry are imaginary; their Arguments are far
fetched; Their Works are like those of the Sophists, they
are thought deep, because unintelligible; they instruct the
People in Absurdities</span>. Would the <em>Spectator</em> allow this
positive Air in any other Writer? How does it appear that
one Word of all this is true? <em>Ipse dixit.</em> That must satisfy,
though he is in this Case too much a Party, to be a Judge.
<span class="quotation">These <em>Criticks</em> are led themselves into Absurdities, by not
considering, That there is sometimes a greater Judgement
shewn in deviating from the Rules of Art, than adhering
to them</span>. The Word <em>sometimes</em> here would make every
right Argument wrong, and every Truth Falsehood, because
<em>sometimes</em> there may be an Exception to a general
Rule. Why, does he not tell us, wherein himself, or any
one else shewed his Judgement in deviating from the Rules
of Art? The <em>Critical Smatterers</em> do not charge him in
those Places where Judgement was shewn in such deviating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
but where the Want of Judgement appeared in it. I shall
have occasion to touch this Subject a little elsewhere;
though I hope what I have said here, is enough to prove
that just <em>Criticisms</em> are not the Productions of Ignorance
and Envy, as the <em>Spectator</em> intimates; but that they are,
on the contrary, useful and necessary to be a Check on the
greatest Genius's, who want the Rein much more than
the Spur; and what, in a few Years, would become of
all good Writing, if those great Genius's could impose
their very Blemishes on the World for the most shining
Beauties?</p>

<p>The <em>Spectator</em> gives us another Mark, by which we
may discover a Critick, who has neither Taste nor Learning,
and that is, <span class="quotation">He seldom ventures to praise any Passage
in an Author, which has not been before received and
applauded by the Publick</span>. If this Remark had been infallible
and universal, it must have deprived the <em>Spectator</em>
himself of the two greatest Beauties in all his Quotations
out of <em>Milton</em> which are in every one's Mouth.
The One in the sublime Kind in the Speech to the
<em>Sun</em>.</p>

<p>which had before been a thousand Times repeated as
the Perfection of <em>English</em> Poetry, in their several Kinds.
And the Author, who shall have occasion to quote them
as such after the <em>Spectator</em>, will not discover his Want of
Taste or Learning by it. Very just is his Observation,
<span class="quotation">A true Critick ought to dwell rather upon Excellencies than
Imperfections, &amp;c.</span> But as this has Relation chiefly to
those Compositions which require Genius, Judgement and
Eloquence; and consequently, cannot relate to Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s
History of <em>England</em>, we shall now say no more of it.</p>

<p>That I may not be guilty of the Fault I blame in others,
the neglecting of Beauties, and falling unmercifully upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Blemishes of Authors. I must sincerely acknowledge,
that it was not for Want of Will, that I did not mention
what is beautiful in our Historian, but for Want of Opportunity.
What Part of his Performance should I have
applauded! Is it the <em>Design</em>! The Author does not himself
pretend, that it is regular, if by <em>Design</em> in <em>History</em>,
we are to understand the <em>Plan</em> as in <em>Poetry</em>: He will
not deny, but that his Method is too much diversified,
and too confused; sometimes it is <em>General History</em>, sometimes
<em>Annals</em>, sometimes a <em>Diary</em>, sometimes <em>Biography</em>;
all which he seems to think he has sufficiently provided
against, by dividing the whole Work into <em>Sections</em>,
and putting Pales between his Paragraphs. This Confusion
will be easily pardoned by his Readers, there being
hardly one in a Thousand that knows the Difference between
<em>Biography</em> and <em>History</em>, or between an <em>Annalist</em> and
an <em>Historian</em>; or who does not take <em>Buck</em>'s <em>Richard</em> III, or
<em>Cambden</em>'s Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>, to be as much of the historical
Kind, as <em>Samuel Daniel</em>'s History of <em>England</em>,
which is the only <em>English</em> History that has the least Appearance
of Uniformity and Regularity of Design.</p>

<p><em>Ne Sutor ultra Crepidam</em>, is in nothing a more necessary
Maxim, than in the Productions of the Mind. It is
not because a Man can write a Sonnet, an Elegy, nay, an
Ode, or a Dramatick Poem, that therefore he can succeed
in Epick; though we in <em>England</em> are apt to confound
all Sorts of Poetry and Poets, and to think that
there is but one and the same Genius necessary for all of
them. Thus it is, that you often hear the Question in
Company, which is the best Poet, <em>Virgil</em> or <em>Horace</em>, <em>Milton</em>
or <em>Waller</em>, <em>Dryden</em> or <em>Wycherley</em>, <em>Congreve</em> or <em>Row</em>.
It is the same Thing in History: If a Man is able to
abridge a Dictionary, to collect and compile Memoirs;
in a Word, if he can put a Tale together, he is immediately
an Historian, though Story-telling and History are
as different as a <em>Madrigal</em> and a Pindarick <em>Ode</em>.</p>

<p>History is designed to instruct Mankind by Example,
to shew what Men were by what they did, and from particular
Instances to form general Lessons in all the various
Stations of Life; and our Historian has so far a just
Conception of its Dignity and Use, that he speaks of his
own Performance as if he had formed a regular noble Design,
with a regular and noble View, and executed it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
equal Beauty and Perfection. Very great Talents are requisite
to succeed in it, especially that of Judgement, to
relate only what is worth relating, and to make proper
Reflections upon Events for the Instruction of the Reader.
<span class="quotation">Nothing is more necessary for an Historian</span>, says <em>Pere Rapin</em>,
<span class="quotation">than Judgement: Nothing requires so much Sense,
so much Reason, so much Wit, so much Wisdom, and other
good Qualities, as History, to succeed in writing it; and
above all, <em>Un Heureux Naturel</em>, a happy Genius, which
endowed with all these Qualifications, will not do without,
<em>Un Grand Commerce du Monde</em>, a great Knowledge
of the World</span>. <em>Pere Bouhours</em>, whom Mr. <em>Addison</em>
thought the most judicious and penetrating of all the
<em>French</em> Criticks, has an admirable Remark on the Reflections
of Historians, in his <em>Maniere de bien penser</em>.
The <span class="quotation">Historian ought to shine most in his Reflections: Nothing
is so irregular as to reflect falsely on Events that are
true</span>. He mentions a pleasant Instance of a <em>French</em>
Priest, who said in a Sermon, <span class="quotation">The Heart of Man being
of a triangular Figure, and the World of a round one;
It is plain, that all worldly Greatness cannot fill the Heart
of Man</span>. We have been told a thousand Times, that
the <em>Presbyterians</em> had a Quarrel with King <em>Charles</em> the
First, and that those who had a Quarrel with him, took
him and cut off his Head. The Fact is true as to the
Quarrel, but nothing can be more false, than that the
<em>Presbyterians</em> beheaded him. The Fact is true, that the
Act of Toleration put a Stop to the Persecuting of Dissenters;
but the Reflection from it, <em>That the Church
was in Danger</em>, is false. If I would rifle the <em>Grand Rebellion</em>,
and Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s History, I might have the Honour
of being Author of a Folio too, by taking from
them Examples of this Kind; and I cannot but think,
if the Archdeacon had duely weighed the Difficulties inseparable
from his Undertaking, the indispensable Duty
of Sincerity and Truth, and the great Talents necessary for
an Historian, he would have transferred the Work to another,
not a Dealer in Records only, from whom one can
expect nothing but the naked Facts without Form or
Order, without Ornament, or even cloathing; very proper
for Evidence in Tryals at Law, but too rude and unpolished
for the Beauty and Elegance of History: Yet
I am satisfied, there is not one Man in a Thousand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<em>England</em>, but thinks there are no Writers so fit to make
Historians as your Record Keepers and Library Keepers,
who are just as necessary in such Work as Masons
and Carpenters are in Architecture, and no more in Comparison
with the Architect, than the <em>Axe</em> or the <em>Chissel</em>
are in Comparison with them. <span class="quotation">An excellent Historian</span>,
says Mons. <em>Pellisson</em>, Pref. to <em>Sar.</em> <span class="quotation">ought to have a
general Knowledge of the World and of Affairs, and a
subtle and penetrating Wit, to distinguish the true Causes
of humane Actions, from the Pretexts and Colours which
are given them</span>. Thus our Historian should have distinguish'd
Archbishop <em>Laud</em>'s natural Pride and Severity,
from that Piety and Zeal which are the <em>Pretexts and
Colours</em> that are given them. He should also have distinguish'd
the Pique and Partiality in the Grand Rebellion
from Truth and Sincerity, which are the Pretexts and
Colours. Again,</p>

<p><em>Tacitus</em>, said he, wrote <em>Sine studio Partium &amp; Ira</em>;
if the same may be said of the two Historians in Question,
I have done them much Wrong. The late Earl of
<em>Shaftsbury</em>, in his Letter of <em>Enthusiasm</em>, has this Expression:
<span class="quotation">We have few modern Writers, who, like <em>Xenophon</em>
or <em>Cicero</em>, can write their own Commentaries, and
the raw Memoir Writings, and uninformed Pieces of modern
Statesmen full of their own interested and private
Views, will, in another Age, be of little Service to support
their Memory or Name, since already the World begins
to sicken with them</span>.</p>

<p>It is somewhat strange, that Mr. <em>Echard</em> should not be
so well acquainted with the Weakness of the vulgar Humour
in <em>England</em>, as a Foreigner; who was so sensible of
the Peoples Fondness to hear Stories, that he excuses those
of a better Taste amongst them, who cannot relish such as
relate to Ghosts, Devils, Prophecies, and the like, with
which the Archdeacon's History abounds. The Author
of the <em>Paris Journal des Sçavans</em>, speaking of <em>English</em>
History Writers, and their bringing in Prophecies and
strange Stories, says, <span class="quotation">Granting it to be true, it is not so
much to be attributed to their Want of Skill, as to their
Compliance with the Humour of the People, that attend too
much to Prophecies, and are too much affected with Tales</span>;
which Humour our Historian has rather indulged than
discountenanced, and it must surely be for Want of Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ment,
after the indulging them in it, had been so much
exploded. The <em>French</em> Historian <em>Maimbourg</em> participates
of the same Character, and his Zeal for the Church, could
not procure him a better one abroad, than what was given
him in <em>Italy</em>, that he was among Historians, what <em>Momus</em>
is among the Gods, <em>only to tell Tales</em>; with which
the Vulgar are as well contented, as with Relations that
are truly historical. But we should be as cautious of reading
such Histories, as <em>Menage</em> tells us he was of reading
<em>Morreri</em>'s, for Fear we should remember them. <em>Collier</em>
knew better than <em>Menage</em>, and therefore translated <em>Morreri</em>'s
three Folio's into <em>English</em>, as a rich Store for the
Memories of his Countrymen.</p>

<p>Having so little Reason to commend the Historian
for his <em>Design</em>, I should make him amends in the Sentiments,
if there was the least Room for it. It is true,
in History, if the Facts are fairly related, the Sentiments
must be brought along with them, and the Author is not
accountable for them as in Poetry: But if the Sentiments
do not correspond with the Facts; if Meekness and Holiness
are seated to give Judgement in the <em>High Commission</em>
and <em>Star Chamber</em> Courts; if Piety is mounted on
Horseback with the Lord High Treasurer's Staff in her
Hand; if the most noble Characters are ascribed to Persons
engaged in the most unjustifiable Actions, we may
depend upon it, these Persons, either did not think, or did
not act as they are represented, and consequently that the
History is false and vicious: The Historians Reflections
upon Events are entirely his own, and we shall see in the
following Pages, how wise and how weighty they are:
But as they bear all on one Side, like an ill ballasted
Ship, it is much, if in the Course of a few Years, it does
not overset the History.</p>

<p>There is no greater Vice in Historians, than poor and
common Reflections. The Poverty of the Archdeacon's
appears in the <em>After Wit</em>, which makes a good Part of
them; and the <em>Vulgarisms</em>, which will be further explain'd
as Occasions often.</p>

<p>Indeed we do not enough acquaint ourselves in <em>England</em>,
with what Father <em>Bouhours</em> calls the <span class="quotation">Manner of Right
Thinking</span>, in his Treatise before mentioned; which <em>Fontenelle</em>
recommends as one of the most agreeable and useful
Books in the <em>French</em> Tongue: We have nothing like it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
in <em>English</em>, or in any other Language antient or modern,
Wit and Humour, Wit and good Sense, Wit and Wisdom,
Wit and Reason, Wit and Craft; nay, Wit and Philosophy,
are with us almost the same things. How often
have I heard it said, there is a great Deal of Wit in <em>Homer</em>,
a great Deal of Humour in <em>Virgil</em>. We take all
Thoughts in the Gross; the Sublime, the Grand, the
Noble, the Pretty, the Agreeable, the Fine, the Delicate,
are all alike witty with us; and the Vulgar are ignorant
of all other Distinction, but that of a <em>Jest</em> and a <em>Bull</em>.
Sir <em>Samuel Garth</em>, who was extreamly fond of Father
<em>Bouhours</em>'s Treatise, did often wish that it was translated,
and the Examples the <em>French</em> Critick takes from <em>Greek</em>,
<em>Latin</em>, <em>Italian</em>, <em>Spanish</em> and <em>French</em> Authors, not to be
turned into <em>English</em>, but <em>English</em> Examples to be put instead
of them. I am satisfied nothing would be of more
Advantage towards the Refinement of our Manner, both
of Thinking and Writing. I know the Undertaking
would be very difficult, and the greatest Part of the Difficulty
be to preserve the Spirit and Turn of Thought
in the <em>English</em> Examples, to make it answer Father <em>Bouhours</em>'s
Remarks. Who is there, that does not take a
sublime Thought, a noble Thought, a grand Thought,
to be synonymous Terms, though they differ from one
another, almost as much as from the Agreeable and the
Delicate. I am my self afraid to attempt any Thing
like Examples of Kinds, and probably my Conceptions
of them may be wrong; what they are I shall offer them
to the Reader, with the Caution and Submission which
becomes me in a Matter so intricate and nice.</p>

<p>The first Example of the <em>Sublime</em> is so well known,
that if there was any other so good in any other Author,
I should not have made use of it. It is in the 7th
Chapter of <em>Longinus</em>. We will not borrow it from <em>Boileau</em>,
because we are forbidden by the <em>Spectator</em> to make
Use of a Quotation which has been made Use of before.
Dr. <em>Gregory</em>, in the Preface to his Works, printed about
sixty Years ago, at what Time <em>Boileau</em> had not thought
of translating <em>Longinus</em>, writes thus: <span class="quotation"><em>Dionysius Longinus</em>,
one that knew what belonged to Expression</span>; having
first of all cast a Scorn upon his <em>Homer</em>. The Translator
does not dwell much upon this, <span class="quotation">says &#932;&#8182;&#957; &#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#969;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#952;&#8051;&#964;&#951;&#962;
that the Law-givers of the Jews, &#8008;&#965;&#967; &#8001; &#964;&#965;&#967;&#8060;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#8052;&#961;, no or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>dinary
Man, was in the Right when he brought in his
God</span>, saying, &#915;&#949;&#957;&#8051;&#963;&#952;&#969; &#966;&#8182;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</p>

<p>But least it may be said, the <em>Spectator</em> has entered a
Caveat against my using any Quotation, which he or any
one else had used, I shall add another Instance of the
Sublime taken out of the same divine Book the Bible,
that has not been blown upon:</p>

<p>What in all profane Learning comes up to the <em>Sublime</em>

<p>There are not ten finer Verses together in Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s

Years old.</p>

<p>The <em>French</em> perhaps have been a little too scrupulous

<p>There would be no End of it, if one should go about
to enumerate such Instances as these out of <em>Milton</em>. His
Poem of <em>Paradise lost</em> is so full of them, that almost out
of one Book one might collect as many such noble Passages,
as out of all the <em>Æneis</em>; and I would add the
<em>Ilias</em> too, if I understood <em>Greek</em> half so well as the
Translator.</p>

<p>Among the many Sketches of the glorious Character
of King <em>William</em> in that of <em>Tamerlane</em>, Mr. <em>Row</em> has
this, which I take to be a very noble Image:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No Lust of Rule, the common Vice of Kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No furious Zeal inspir'd by hot-brain'd Priests:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ill hid beneath Religions specious Name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'er drew his temp'rate Courage to the Field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to redress an injur'd Peoples Wrongs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save the weak One from the strong Oppressour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all his End of War; and when he draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sword to punish, like relenting Heav'n,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seems unwilling to deface Mankind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Opposition in the following Passage, carries with
it its own Application:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As oft regardless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of plighted Faith, with most unkingly Baseness<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He has t'ane Advantage of their absent Arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To waste with Sword and Fire their fruitful Fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some accursed Fiend, who 'scap'd from Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poisons the balmy Air thro' which he flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He blasts the bearded Corn, and loaded Branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lab'ring Hind's best Hopes, and marks his Way with Ruin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is there not something noble in what Mr. <em>Waller</em> says
to the Duke of <em>Monmouth</em>, at his Return from suppressing
a Rebellion in <em>Scotland</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But seeing Envy like the Sun does beat,<br /></span>

<p>I hope I may make Use of Part of Mr. <em>Addison</em>'s

</div></div>

<p>Having mention'd so many noble Thoughts in Verse,
I shall conclude this Article, with a very plain but very
noble one in Prose, the Saying of <em>Leonidas</em> to <em>Xerxes</em>:
<span class="quotation">If you had not been too powerful and too happy, you might
have been an honest Man.</span></p>

<p>Tho' it is a very hard Matter to distinguish the <em>Grand</em>
from the <em>Noble</em> in the Manner of Thinking, yet we shall
endeavour it by the following Examples; and sure nothing
can be more <em>Grand</em>, than the Saying of <em>Alexander
the Great</em>, to the Greatest of his Captains <em>Parmenio</em>,
<em>Darius</em>, King of <em>Persia</em>, having offer'd the <em>Macedonian</em>
Monarch half <em>Asia</em> in Marriage with his Daughter <em>Statira</em>.
<span class="quotation">As for me</span>, says <em>Parmenio</em>, <span class="quotation">if I were <em>Alexander</em>, I would
accept of these Offers</span>: <span class="quotation">And so would I</span>, reply'd that
Prince, <span class="quotation">If I were <em>Parmenio</em>.</span> But why should we be always
dealing in <em>Heroicks</em>, and running back into Antiquity
to borrow Example from the Conquerors of the World.
Why may not we propose one in the lowest Life, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
will at the same Time prove, that the Excellencies of
both Thought and Expression are in Nature, and not in
the Rules of Art only. A Sergeant of the Guards, <span class="quotation">What
a terrible Fall is this, from <em>Alexander the Great</em>, to a
Sergeant of the Guards!</span> who was in the last Attack
upon the Castle of <em>Namur</em> in King <em>William</em>'s War, after
he had fir'd his Grenades at the Enemy behind the Palisadoes,
leapt over them, and had been slaughter'd, had
not a <em>French</em> Officer prevented it. The Sergeant being a
Prisoner in the Castle was sent for by the Governour Count
<em>Guiscard</em>, and the Mareschal <em>de Boufflers</em>. The Latter
demanding how he durst attempt to leap the Palisadoes
with the Enemy behind them, when he could hardly
have done it had there been none? <span class="quotation">Perhaps, Sir, I might
not,</span> reply'd the brave <em>English</em> Soldier, <span class="quotation">but there is nothing
too difficult for me to come at my Enemy.</span> A Saying
worthy of <em>Alexander</em> or <em>Cæsar</em>, of <em>Marlborough</em> or
<em>Eugene</em>.</p>

<p>I have seen something like these Verses of Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s,
quoted as in the grand Way of Thinking:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great <em>Maro</em> could no greater Tempest feign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the loud Winds usurping on the Main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For angry <em>Juno</em> labour'd to destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hated Relicks of confounded <em>Troy</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the Image, as grand as it is, does not seem
to be so noble as the Instances before-mentioned; there
is too much Terrour in it to participate of that Kind of
Thought, which is not confident with what is terrible.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking there is something <em>Grand</em> in this
<em>Epitaph</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Underneath this Marble Hearse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies the Subject of all Verse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Sidney</em>'s Sister, <em>Pembroke</em>'s Mother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death 'ere thou hast kill'd another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair and learn'd, and good as she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time shall throw a Dart at thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To descend to the lower Kinds, we meet with what
Father <em>Bouhours</em> calls <em>Pensées Jolliées</em> pretty Thoughts;
and we have of that Kind too in <em>English</em>, perhaps to a
greater Degree of Excellence, than is to be found in any
other Language; especially those Verses in the <em>Spectator</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
which are said there to be Originals, as indeed they are,
and inimitable. I question whether a Poet might not as
easily imitate <em>Milton</em> or <em>Butler</em>. There are ten <em>Stanza</em>'s,
and they all of a like pretty, and natural Turn with
the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><em>IIId <span class="smcap">Stanza</span>.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Fountain that wont to run sweetly along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dance to soft Murmurs the Pebbles among;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st little Cupid, if <em>Ph&#339;be</em> was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere Pleasure to look at, 'twere Musick to hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now she is absent I walk by its Side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still as it murmurs do nothing but chide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must you be so chearful, while I go in Pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace there with your Bubbling, and hear me complain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How the <em>French</em> may compare with us, as to this <em>pretty</em>
Manner, let us see by a Comparison. <em>Menage</em> says,
that this <em>Triolet</em>, as he calls it, a Sort of low Poetry
where one or two Verses are repeated three Times, was
the King of <em>Triolet</em>'s, and written by the famous Mons.
<em>Ranchin</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Le premier Jour de May</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Fut le plus Heureux de ma Vie,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Le beau Design que je formay</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Le premier Jour de May.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first Day of the Month of <em>May</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the Happiest of my Life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah the fair Design I form'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first Day if the Month of <em>May</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then saw you, then I lov'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you like this fair Design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first Day of the Month of <em>May</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the Happiest of my Life.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now let us see what an <em>English</em> Poet has said on the
First of <em>May</em>; and tho' there is in it hardly any Thing
but Words, and those Words rustick to Affectation; yet
they are <em>Prettiness</em> itself compared to Mons. <em>Ranchin</em>'s
Guardian, N<sup>o</sup> 124:</p>

<p>Tho' there is little Meaning here, yet the Dancing of
the Words and the Sprightliness of the Images, make it
a prettier Lyrick than our <em>Italian</em> Opera's can produce.</p>

<p>According to my Conception nothing can be prettier
than this Thought of <em>Buchanan</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Ilia mihi semper presenti dura</em> Neæra;<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>Me, quoties absum, semper abesse dolet;</em><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Cruel, when I am present, she appears;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not that <em>Neæra</em> wishes my Return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see me love her, but to see me mourn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These Verses of Mr. <em>Waller</em> are, methinks, as pretty as
they are gallant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Phillis</em>, why should we delay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasures shorter than the Day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cou'd we, which we never can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch our Lives beyond their Span;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty like a Shadow flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our Youth before us dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or would Youth and Beauty stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love hath Wings, and will away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love hath swifter Wings than Time, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>Notice has been taken of the Prettiness of these Verses
in <em>Dryden</em>'s Fable of the <em>Cock</em> and the <em>Fox</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Cock</em> speaks to his Wife Dame <em>Partlet</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;See my Dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How lavish Nature hath adorn'd the Year;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All these are ours, and I with Pleasure see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man strutting on two Legs, and aping me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Madam <em>Dacier</em> takes Notice of a very pretty Circumstance
in <em>Sappho</em>'s Hymn to <em>Venus</em>, translated into <em>Latin</em> by
<em>Catullus</em>, and into <em>English</em> by Mr. <em>Philips</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou once didst leave Almighty <em>Jove</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the golden Roofs above:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Carre thy wanton Sparrows drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hov'ring in Air, they lightly flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to my Bow'r, they wing'd their Way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw their quiv'ring Pinions play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Birds dismist, while you remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore back their empty Carre again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Circumstance that renders it so pretty, according
to the <em>Critical Lady</em>, is <em>Venus</em>'s dismissing her Sparrows
and her Carre, and shewing she did not intend to make
<em>Sappho</em> a Court-Visit, but to dwell with her some Time.
There's another Ode of <em>Sappho</em>, which is preserved in
<em>Longinus</em>, and translated by <em>Boileau</em>. It is in the sublime
Kind, and shews the Violence of Love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From Vein to Vein I feel a subtle Flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When e'er I see thee, run thro' all my Frame:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'm dumb, and neither Tongue nor Voice can find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Mist of Pleasure o'er my Eyes is spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear no more, and am to Reason dead;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I burn, I freeze, I tremble, and I die.<br /></span>

<p>In the <em>Spectator</em>, N<sup>o</sup> 388. is a Paraphrase on the second
Chapter of <em>Solomon</em>'s Song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>To descend again to the lower Kinds of Thinking, I
shall conclude the Pretty with these Verses of Mr. <em>Prior</em>'s
on the Squirrel in the Cage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mov'd in the Orb, pleas'd with the Chimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foolish Creature thinks he climbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bus here or there, turn Wood or Wire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never gets two Inches higher.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares it with those merry Blades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That frisk it under Pindus Shades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In noble Songs, and lofty Odes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They tread on Stars, and talk with gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still dancing in an airy Round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still pleas'd with their own Verses Sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought back how fast soe'er they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always aspiring, always low.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Agreeable Thoughts may be also reckon'd among the
Natural, the Soft, and the Tender; all which in the general
Acceptation, are also taken for Wit. This Speech
of <em>Eve</em>'s to <em>Adam</em> in the <em>Paradice Lost</em>, has an Agreeableness
which cannot be match'd in the most Tender of our
Lyrick or Elegiac Poets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">His orient Beams, on Herb, Tree, Fruit and Flow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glistring with Dew: Fragrant the fertile Earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After soft Show'rs, and sweet the Coming on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of grateful Evening mild: Then silent Night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And these the Gems of Heaven, her starry Train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But neither Breath of Morn, when she ascends<br /></span>

<p>To speak poetically one would think every Verse was
turn'd and polish'd by the <em>Loves</em> and the <em>Graces</em>. Indeed
all the Conversation between the first Bridegroom and his
Bride, in this Poem, is exquisitely agreeable and tender,
except the very Incident of the Fall.</p>

<p>I take the Verses in <em>Waller</em>, address'd to <em>Amoret</em>, to
be of the agreeable Kind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair, that you may truly know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What you unto <em>Thyrsis</em> owe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will tell you how I do<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Sacharissa</em> love, and you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Joy salutes me, when I set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My blest Eyes on <em>Amoret</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with Wonder I am strook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I on the Other look.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If sweet <em>Amoret</em> complains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have Sense of all her Pains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for <em>Sacharissa</em> I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not only grieve, but die. <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I could give many Instances of agreeable Thoughts
but of <em>Dryden</em>'s Fables, especially that of <em>Cymon</em> and
<em>Iphigenia</em>, which had been taken notice of long enough
before the <em>Spectator</em> was thought of; and I do not think
it fair, that he should engross all the <em>Beaux Endroits</em>,
because he printed them first. The Rusticity of <em>Cymon</em>,
and even his Stupidity, has something in it very agreeable
in the Image, which is the pure Nature that we meet
with there:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It happen'd on a Summer's Holy-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the Greenwood Shade he took his Way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Quarter-Staff, which he cou'd ne'er forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung half before, and half behind his Back;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He trudg'd along unknowing what he sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whistled as he went for Want of Thought.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is not a more natural Picture in Language than
this. Of the same Kind is that of <em>Iphigenia</em> sleeping by
the Fountain: The very Numbers express the Wantonness
of the Wind so livelily, that we feel the Air, and are
fanned by it while we read them, which I think has had
the good Luck to escape Observation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her Bosom to the View was only bare;<br /></span>
<div style="float:left; min-width:1%;">
<span class="i0">The fanning Wind upon her Bosom blows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the fanning Wind her Bosom rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fanning Wind, and purling Streams continue her Repose.</span>
<div style="float:right; font-size: 300%; font-style:normal; margin-top:-1.25em; margin-right:-.75em;">}</div>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div></div>


<p>Mr. <em>Dryden</em> was 68 Years old when he wrote this
Fable, which I have always taken for a Master-piece,
with Respect to natural Thoughts, which are always
agreeable, and harmonious Numbers. The Reader will
perceive, that I do not forbear quoting fine Passages,
because they are in the <em>Spectator</em>. I cannot allow of his
Forestalling the Market; and besides, I take his Example
to be preferable to his Precept. Himself does not
stick to quote even from himself; as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>N<sup>o</sup> 91. Sidley</em> has that prevailing gentle Art, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>N<sup>o</sup> [400.] Sidley</em> has that prevailing gentle Art, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guard <em>110. Motto&mdash;&mdash;Non ego paucis,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i4">&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Offendor maculis.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spec. <em>291. Motto&mdash;&mdash;Non ego paucis,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i4">&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Offendor maculis.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This however I will declare in my own Behalf, that I
have quoted nothing from him which he has quoted from
<em>Milton</em> or <em>Dryden</em>, but what I had before collected my
self as remarkable Passages in their several Kinds of
Thinking.</p>

<p>What follows, taken out of Mr. <em>Charles Hopkins</em>'s Verses
to the Earl of <em>Dorset</em>, is of the agreeable Kind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Nature does in new-born Infants frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their first Speech their careful <em>Forstrer</em>'s Name,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose needful Hands their daily Food provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by whose Aid they have their Wants supply'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are, my Lord, the Poet's earliest Theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first Word he speaks is <em>Dorset</em>'s Name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Were not the next Verses written on a Tomb Stone,
they wou'd be very <em>agreeable</em>. They are <em>Ben Johnson</em>'s:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Underneath this Stone doth lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much Virtue as cou'd die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when alive did Vigour give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To as much Beauty as cou'd live.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is not this Picture of <em>Venus</em> in <em>Palamon</em> and <em>Arcite</em> of
the same Kind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Goddess self some noble Hand had wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing Thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Ocean, as she first began to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth'd the ruffled Waves, and clear'd the Skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She trod the Brine, all bare below the Breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green Waves, but ill conceal'd the Rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Lute she held, and on her Head was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Wreath of Roses red, and Myrtles green:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Turtles fan'd the buxom Air above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his Mother stood an Infant Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Wings display'd.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These Verses out of <em>Dryden</em>'s St. <em>Cecilia</em>'s Ode are
very agreeable:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Softly sweet in <em>Lydian</em> Measures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon he sooth'd his Soul to Pleasures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War, he sung, is Toil and Trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour but an empty Bubble.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never ending, still beginning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fighting still, and still destroying;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the World is worth thy Winning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think, Oh think, it worth enjoying.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But as the finest Meats are most apt to surfeit, so too
many agreeable Thoughts together may flatten upon the
Palate: And I shall only add an Instance in Prose, taken
out of Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s Letter to the Lady <em>Lucy Sydney</em>, on
the Marriage of her Sister the Lady <em>Dorothy</em>, who was
his <em>Sacharissa</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="quotation">May my Lady <em>Dorothy</em>, if we may yet call her so,
suffer as much, and have the like Passion for this
young Lord, whom she has preferred to the Rest of Mankind,
as others have had for her; and may this Love before
the Year goes about, make her taste of the first Curse
impos'd upon Woman-kind, the Pains of becoming a Mother.
May the First-born be none of her own Sex; and
may she that always affected Silence and Retiredness, have
the House fill'd with the Noise and Number of her Children.
May she, at last, arrive at that great Curse much
declin'd by fair Ladies, Old Age</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under the Character of Father <em>Bouhours</em>'s fine Thoughts
may be put these Verses of Mr. <em>Waller</em>'s, alluding to his
gallant Poems upon <em>Sacharissa</em>, and the Story of <em>Ph&#339;bus</em>
and <em>Daphne</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet what he sang in his immortal Strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' unsuccessful, was not sung in Vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but the Nymph that should redress his Wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend his Passion, and approve his Song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like <em>Ph&#339;bus</em>, thus acquiring unsought Praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caught at Love, and fill'd his Arms with Bays.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Much of the same Kind is this of the Lord <em>Landsdown</em>'s
on the same Subject:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy Beauty, <em>Sidney</em>, like <em>Achilles</em> Sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resistless stands upon as sure Record;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foremost Herce, and the brightest Dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both sung alike shall have their Fate the same.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Part of Mr. <em>Prior</em>'s Prologue spoken before the
late Queen, is in the fine Way of Thinking:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let the young <em>Austrian</em> then her Terrours bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great as he is, her Delegate in War.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him in Thunder speak to both his <em>Spains</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in these dreadful Isles a Woman reigns:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the bright Queen does on her Subjects show'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle Blessings of her softer Pow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives sacred Morals to a vicious Age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Temples Zeal, and Manners to the Stage;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bids the chaste Muse without a Blush appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Wit be that, which Heaven and she may hear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of what Kind shall we take this Image in <em>Spencer</em>
to be:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His haughty Helmet, horrid all with Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both glorious Brightness and great Terrour bred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the Crest a Dragon did enfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greedy Paws, and over all did spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His golden Wings; his dreadful hideous Head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close couched on the Bever, seem'd to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From flaming Mouth, bright Sparkles fiery red, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This of <em>Cowley</em> is finely thought:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now all the wide extended Sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all th' harmonious Worlds on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <em>Virgil</em>'s sacred Work shall dye.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this of <em>Waller</em> to Queen <em>Henrietta Maria</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A brave Romance who would exactly frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First brings his Knight from some immortal Dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a Weapon and a flaming Shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as his Mother's Eyes, he makes him wield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None might the Mother of <em>Achilles</em> be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fair Pearl and Glory of the Sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Man to whom Great <em>Maro</em> gives such Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the high Bed of heavenly <em>Venus</em> came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our next <em>Charles</em>, whom all the Stars design<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Wonders to accomplish, springs from thine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this to <em>Zelinda</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fairest Piece of well form'd Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge not thus your haughty Birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pow'r, which you have o'er us, lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in your Race, but in your Eyes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And these Verses of Mr. <em>Addison</em> to the Lord <em>Hallifax</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh Liberty, thou Goddess heav'nly bright!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profuse of Bliss, and Pregnant with Delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal Pleasures in thy Presence reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling plenty leads thy wanton Train.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Eas'd of her Load, Subjection grows more light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Poverty looks chearful in thy Sight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mak'st the gloomy Face of Nature gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giv'st Beauty to the Sun, and Pleasure to the Day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These four Verses, Part of the late Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>'s
Poem upon <em>Hobbes</em>, contain, as I conceive, a fine
Thought:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But such the Frailty is of humane Kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men toil for Fame, which no Man lives to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long rip'ning under Ground this <em>China</em> lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame bears no Fruit, till the vain Planter dies.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the next Verses contain a false Thought, if I have
a Right Conception of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Nature tir'd with his unusual Length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Life, which put her to her utmost Strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So vast a Soul, unable to supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save herself, was forc'd to let him die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whatever it is we understand by Nature, we can have
no such Idea of it, as to imagine Mr. <em>Hobbes</em> cou'd have
been too hard for it.</p>

<p>These Verses of Mr. <em>Waller</em>, on <em>Westminster-Abbey</em>
escaping a Fire, are finely imagined:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Snow on <em>Ætna</em> does unmelted lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence rolling Flames, and scatter'd Cinders flie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant Country in the Ruin shares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What falls from Heaven the burning Mountain spares.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tho' some of these <em>fine</em> Thoughts are very nearly allied
to the Noble, yet one may easily perceive, that there is not
so much Dignity, tho' there may be as much Beauty in
the One as in the Other. Thus also, as to delicate and
agreeable Thoughts, they are as nearly related; but a
Thing may be agreeable which is not delicate, tho' it
cannot be delicate, but it must be agreeable: An agreeable
Thought expresses it self entirely; a delicate One
leaves something to the Readers Imagination which is
very flattering.</p>

<p>As in this beauteous old Verse of <em>Chaucer</em>'s, preserv'd
in <em>Dryden</em>'s, <em>Palamon</em> and <em>Arcite</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Uprose the Sun, and uprose <em>Emily</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>Had <em>Chaucer</em> said, <span class="quotation">Up rose the Sun, <em>and then</em> up rose
Emily <em>brighter than the Sun</em></span>, <em>Emily</em> and the Reader
would have been entertain'd with only a common Complement;
but now the Reader fills up the Thought himself,
and imagines that the Sun rose to prepare the Way
for something brighter than himself: <span class="quotation">Up rose <em>Emily</em></span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, in another place,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Day appears, and with the Day the King,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>imitates <em>Chaucer</em>, but the Delicacy is lost, for there is nothing
more to be understood by it, as there is in this Couplet
of his to the Dutchess of <em>Ormond</em> upon her going to
<em>Ireland</em> before the late Duke,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As <em>Ormond</em>'s Harbinger, to you they run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <em>Venus</em> is the Promise of the Sun.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There the Reader fills up the Comparison himself, and
consequently cannot but be pleas'd, as we are apt to be,
with every thing which we do our selves.</p>

<p>The Delicacy of Thought is recommended to us by the
<em>Spectator</em>, in this beautiful Passage out of <em>Milton</em>, where
after the most dismal Prospect of Death, which the Heart
of Man was ever terrify'd with, <em>Adam</em> is presented with
one of the gayest Scenes with which it ever was delighted.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;When from the Tents, behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Beavy of fair Women richly gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Jems and wanton Dress. To the Harp they sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft amorous Ditties, and in Dance came on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Men, tho' Grave, ey'd them, and let their Eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rove without Rein, 'till in the amorous Net<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First caught they lik'd, and each his liking chose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now of Love they treat, till the Evening Star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's Harbinger appear'd; then all in Heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Hymen</em>: Then first to Marriage Rights invok'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Feast and Musick, all the Tents resound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such happy Interview, and fair Event<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Love and Youth not lost: Songs, Garlands, Flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charming Symphonies attach the Heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <em>Adam</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>The Reader takes in the Infection all along in Reading
as <em>Adam</em> does in seeing, and imagines at the End of
the Description the Pleasure of <em>Adam</em>'s Imagination.</p>

<p>Is there not Delicacy in these Verses of Mr. <em>Wallers</em> upon
a Lady's <em>Girdle</em>, which leave the Reader much more
to be imagin'd than is exprest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No Monarch but would give his Crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Arms might do what this has done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Joy, my Grief, my Hope, my Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did all within this Circle move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A narrow Compass, and yet there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells all that's good, and all that's fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me but what this Ribbon bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take all the Rest the Sun goes round.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Father <em>Bouhours</em>, in his <em>Maniere de bien penser</em>, besides
these several Kinds of Thoughts, has the <em>true</em>, the <em>beautiful</em>,
the <em>soft</em>, the <em>natural</em>, the <em>simple</em>, the <em>gay</em>, and many
more, which has spun the Subject so very fine,
that it will not endure handling but by very tender
Fingers.</p>

<p>True Thoughts and false Thoughts are often confounded,
especially, if there's any Point, Glittering or Glaring
in the Latter. Something like distinguishing the one from
the other is attempted in the <em>Guardian</em>, N<sup>o</sup> 110. But I
cannot help thinking that it does not deserve the Recommendation
with which it is introduced in that Paper. We
are told, the Remarks are very curious and just, and must
of Consequence conclude, the Applause which the Author
sinks, because 'twas in favour of himself, was so too.
A very pretty Way of returning a Compliment which he
could not accept of without Offence to his Modesty; but,
I humbly conceive, the Remarks are not very curious, if
they are just; the same having been made a Hundred
times before the publishing of them in the critical Letter;
and whoever would be at the Trouble of taking <em>Dryden</em>
and <em>Lee</em>'s Tragedies to pieces, would find enough of the
like Curiosities.</p>

<p>The first is, <em>Lee</em> makes one of his Persons a <em>Cartesian</em>
Philosopher, 2 or 3000 Years before <em>Descartes</em> was born:
Why did not the Critick remember this too in the same
Tragedy <em>Oedipus</em>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As oft I have at <em>Athens</em> seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Stage arise, and the big Clouds descend.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Several Hundred Years before there was such a Thing
heard of as a Stage at <em>Athens</em>.</p>

<p>The next Thing this Critick takes notice of, is <em>Dryden</em>'s
making <em>Cleomenes</em> a <em>Copernican</em> 2000 Years before
<em>Copernicus</em>'s Time. The Rest of the Criticisms turn upon
the Improbability that Don <em>Sebastian</em> King of <em>Portugal</em>
understood Latin, tho' he never prayed to God in any other
Language; or that the Emperor of <em>Barbary</em> had ever
heard of the Names of <em>Bacchus</em>, <em>Cupid</em>, <em>Castor</em>, and <em>Pollux</em>,
or the Mufti of <em>Archimedes</em>, tho' we are credibly informed,
that most of the Greek and Roman Learning was
translated into <em>Arabick</em>; and it is well known that the <em>Arabians</em>
were the greatest Encouragers of Arts and Sciences
for three or four Centuries, when they were buried all
over Christendom under the Rubbish of Monkery and
Barbarism; and the Revivers of Learning were obliged
to them for their Translations and Comments, which were
turned into <em>Latin</em> out of <em>Arabick</em>. I have not only read
of a Translation of <em>Aristotle</em> with Comments by <em>Aben
Rois</em>, and of <em>Euclid</em> by <em>Nassir Eddyn</em>, with Notes, but of
an <em>Arabick Ovid</em>, where the Fable is the Foundation of
the Work, and several other Classicks in the <em>Arabick</em>
Tongue. How easy would it be to fill up such Critical Epistles
as that in the <em>Guardian</em> with as just and curious
Remarks out of the best Epick Poets! How has <em>Chaucer</em>
confounded the Sacred <em>Scripture</em> History with Pagan
Fables:</p>

<p>I cannot repeat any more of it: These are Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s
Faults, in which, according to the <em>Guardian</em>, there
are more Beauties than in the most elaborate Pieces of
more correct Writers. I confess it grieves me to mention
such Enormities as these are: For no Man can do more
justice to Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s fruitful Imagination, and harmonious
Versification than my self: But it does not therefore
follow, that even Errour in him is more beautiful than
Regularity in others.</p>

<p>It I had more Room, and more Leisure, I should have
endeavour'd to explain the Difference between the several
Ways of Thinking. Some of them I have attempted,
and I hope it may stir up a greater Genius, to do in <em>English</em>
as Pere <em>Bouhours</em> has done in <em>French</em>, which would
introduce a beautiful and just Manner both in Thought
and Expression. It would then be known why it is that
Archbishop <em>Tillotson</em> and Bishop <em>Sprat</em> are both esteem'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Masters of the <em>English</em> Language; why Sir <em>William Temple</em>,
and Sir <em>Roger L'Estrange</em>, the <em>Tatler</em>, and the
<em>Spectator</em>, are generally spoken of as fine Writers; though
their Manner is as different as their Faces. Every Thing
that pleases in Writing is with us, as I have already hinted,
resolved into Wit, whether it be in the Thought or
the Expression. <span class="quotation">Nay some</span>, says the <em>Spectator</em>, <span class="quotation">carry the
Notion of Wit so far, as to ascribe it to Puns and Quibbles,
and even to external Mimickry, and to look upon a
Man as an ingenious Person that can resemble the Tone,
Gesture, or Face of another.</span> With such admirable Judges
as these, Sir <em>Isaac Newton</em>'s Discourse of <em>Fluxions</em> is very
witty, as the Machine called the <em>Orrery</em> was said to be
very <em>wittily</em> contrived. With these <em>Estcourt</em>, <em>Penkethman</em>,
and even <em>Norris</em> are Wits, as the <em>Spaniards</em> take the
<em>Apes</em> to be, and that they won't speak because they would
not work. I have known two or three Actors who got into
Vogue by Grimace only, and acting Parts that had neither
Wit nor Sense in them.</p>

<p>Every one of the Kinds of right Thinking has its opposite,
as every Virtue has its Vice; and the Sublime
especially is apt to be mistaken in the Pomp and Puffiness
of Description. Of this Kind is that Passage, where
Mr. <em>Eachard</em> describes the Sea-Fight between the <em>English</em>
and the <em>Dutch</em>, in the Time of the <em>Rump</em>.</p>

<p>"The Battle grew so fierce and so furious, that there
were scarce any Thing to be seen but Masts <em>overturn'd</em>
into the Sea, <em>Splinters</em> flying on all Sides, <em>Sails</em> rent
and torn in Pieces, Cables and <em>Cordage</em> cut in sunder:
<em>How it terrifies one!</em> In one Place a <em>Vessel</em> boarded, and
in a Moment the Men chaced off or blown up with the
Decks into the Air. <em>Four or Five Hundred Men would
not have made a Figure dreadful enough unless the
Wooden Decks had gone along with them.</em> And in
another was seen a Ship swallow'd up by the Waves
with several Hundreds of Men, and the Sea turn'd
red with Human Gore, and cover'd with dead Bodies,
and floating Parts of scatter'd Ships. <span class="quotation">What's the Reason
that we freeze in the midst of so much <em>Fire</em>? This is
what the <em>French</em> call the Cold and the Puerile Stile.</span>
Again; All which instead of dismaying the Combatants,
serv'd only to excite their Rage, and enflame
them to a more cruel and implacable Slaughter; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the continual Outcries of miserable wounded Wretches
render'd them but the more bloody minded, and rouz'd
them to a more cruel and remorseless Revenge. The
rising Coasts on both Sides the Channel were violently
shaken with the resounding Thunders of the
roaring Guns, and those engag'd seem'd to be involv'd
in the Wreck of Nature."</p>

<p>This Fight was over against the Island of <em>Portland</em>, and
I really believe the pronouncing of these Words, <em>roaring
Guns</em>, <em>resounding Thunders</em>, <em>rising Coasts</em>, <em>Wreck of Nature</em>,
among the Rocks under the Light-houses, would have
as good an Effect with the Help of Eccho, as a Broadside
at Sea, which the Historian assures us at the same Time
shook the Hills of <em>England</em> and <em>France</em>. Whence comes
it that we read all this without the least Emotion, where
there is so much Affectation to move? Are we not so stun'd
with the Sound that the Sense is lost in it, and we are
no more concern'd than at the Sight of a Storm in a Half-penny
Picture? <em>Dryden</em> lets us a little into this Secret in
his <em>Preface</em> to <em>Troil.</em> and <em>Cress.</em> He is speaking of the
puffy Style, <span class="quotation">the common Practice of those Writers, who
not being able to infuse a natural Passion into the Mind,
have made it their Business to ply the Ears, and to stun
their Judges by the Noise</span>. A better Judge than Mr. <em>Dryden</em>
has directed us in this Matter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Words, which in Magnificence abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow tedious oft, and lose themselves in Sound.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This Way of Writing is much more easy than that
which is truly great and sublime, as in Liquors, 'tis easier
to give them Ferment and Froth, than Spirit and Purity.
<span class="quotation">There are more Authors</span>, says <em>Dryden</em>, who can make a
<span class="quotation">pompous Description, than who can write with an equal
and natural Stile</span>. He adds, that <em>Shakespear</em> himself did
not distinguish <span class="quotation">the blown puffy Stile from true Sublimity</span>;
which could not wholly be attributed to the Time, because
we meet with the true Sublimity very often in <em>Spencer</em>
and <em>Fairfax</em>, who were both Contemporaries with
<em>Shakespear</em>, and <em>Spencer</em> much the elder. Two Lines of
Sir <em>John Denham</em>'s, on a like Subject with that of <em>Echard</em>,
fills one with Horrour and Amazement.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Addison</em> observes after <em>Pere Bouhours</em>, That <span class="quotation">it is
impossible for any Thought to be beautiful, which is not
just, and has not its Foundation in the Nature of Things:
That the Basis of all Wit is Truth, and that no Thought
can be valuable, of which good Sense is not the Ground-work</span>.
Therefore when Mr. <em>Echard</em> writes his <em>Oxcellency</em>
for his <em>Excellency</em>, speaking of the Parliament's General
the Earl of <em>Essex</em>, the <em>Tyrannical</em> Parliament for the
<em>Triennial</em> Parliament, the New <em>Noddle</em> for the <em>New Model</em>
with respect to the Army, and the like, we are not to be
imposed upon by him, and to take it upon his bare Word
for Wit. Neither is there any Wit at all in his burlesquing
such Phrases as these; <em>Presence of God</em>, <em>Seeking
the Lord</em>, <em>Call of God</em>, <em>Jesus Christ</em>, &amp;c. Which he
also would impose upon us for Witicisms.</p>

<p>His Descriptions are not all so lofty and sounding as
that of the <em>Sea-Fight</em>, particularly when he paints <em>Oliver
Cromwel</em>, without his Breeches, running away from the
Cavaliers in his <em>Drawers</em> only, and then turning back
upon them and beating them. Of this Kind is the incomparable
Picture of the Aldermen <em>Gloucester</em>: Their
<span class="quotation">Visages were pale, lean, and ugly; their Cloaths strange
and unusual; their Voices pert, shrill, and fearless</span>; Ambassadors
<span class="quotation">from the godly City of Gloucester</span>. His Similes
are not more elevated, especially that where he
compares the <em>Silent</em> and <em>Victorious</em> General Monk to
a Cat, and General <em>Lambert to a Mouse</em>. He watched
him as a Cat watches a Mouse, a singular Proof of his
Perfection in Eloquence, which naturally leads us to <em>Expression</em>,
and I doubt not the Historian thinks a finer
Historical Stile than his own is not to be met with.</p>

<p>As in Thoughts so in Expression, we in <em>England</em> are
apt to confound all the various Kinds under the general
Terms of good Language, and a fine Stile. The Sublime,
the Natural, the Didactick, the Narrative, the Tragick,
the Comick, the Polite, the Affected, are seldom rightly
distinguish'd, and the latter very often mistaken for the
Polite. The Admirers of Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s History do, doubtless,
take what follows to have as much of the Sublime
in it as the <em>English</em> Tongue is capable of. It introduces
the glorious Reign of King <em>Charles</em> II.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="quotation">Having gone through a stormy and tempestuous Season of
various Misery, we arrive at a sudden Brightness and
Splendour, a most unexpected Order, and glorious Calm and
Sunshine. The Splendour and Brightness harder to be born
than the preceeding Clouds and Darkness.</span> What is Stormy
and Tempestuous? what Brightness, Sunshine, and Splendour?
What Clouds and Darkness? but other Words for
the same Things, and instead of Amplification comes
under the Denomination of another Figure very common
in such puffy Rhetorick, call'd <em>Tautology</em>, which I am
afraid the Historian and his Admirers mistake for the Sublime,
there being but very few that can distinguish Sound
from Sense, or Wind from Spirit. <span class="quotation">Let a Discourse be never
so fine</span>, says <em>Rapin</em>, <span class="quotation">it loses its worth when 'tis out of
its Place, and appears affected</span>. Affectation in Stile has
the same Effect with ordinary Judges as Affectation in
Air has with Women and Fops. It passes upon them for
Politeness; and Delicacy, tho' there is nothing more vicious
in Language. I might fill a Volume with Examples
of this Vice, taken out of the Earl of <em>Clarendon</em>, and the
Archdeacon's Histories, but as I had never troubled my self
about them, had there been nothing in them but Want of
Method, and an affected Stile, I shall content my self with
two or three Observations only, which are sufficient to convince
all those that can judge right; and as for others, I
have not Leisure nor Words enough to attempt it.</p>

<p>He says the Sight of the <em>Gloucester</em> Aldermen at once
<span class="quotation">gave Mirth to the most severe Countenances, and Sadness
to the most cheerful Hearts</span>. What Idea can one have of
these <em>Cavaliers</em>, as he expresses himself, but that of some
Idiots whom we have seen to laugh and cry in a Breath.
He has two Expressions about Mines, which are very extraordinary,
both as he is a <em>Naturalist</em> and as he is an <em>Orator</em>:
The one is the <em>Brass-Mine</em> in <em>Cumberland</em>, the only
<em>Brass-Mine</em> that ever was, or ever will be in the World.
A <em>Copper-Mine</em> might have been found out there, and a
Mine of <em>Lapis calaminaris</em>, which put together, would
produce <em>Brass</em> enough, if there were Ore enough. Where
he speaks of the Cleanliness of his Writing, he intimates,
that he is one of those who <span class="quotation">dive into the rich Mines of
Nature</span>. What can one imagine about diving better than
that of a Duck and a Dog in a Pond, or Boys in the <em>Bath</em>?
To dive into a Mine, methinks, is like running a Man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Head into a Rock. If he had said he had been digging
in the rich Mines of Nature, one might have expected
some Mettal to have come of it, of one Sort or another.
When the Parliament, that brought in King <em>Charles</em> II,
met the first Time, Mr. <em>Echard</em> says, <span class="quotation">We are now arrived
at the <span class="spread">VAST</span> Day</span>, which I humbly conceive to be beyond
Conception, and a strange Specimen of the Author's
Talent in Elocution. He had a mind to make this Day
something <em>prodigious</em> and <em>uncommon</em>, and therefore swells
it up with an Epithet which bursts in the Operation.
<span class="spread">VAST</span> might have been proper, if he had been speaking
of the Ton of <em>Heidelbergh</em>, or Admiral <em>Russel</em>'s Punch
Bowl at <em>Lisbon</em>: But under what Figure will he put Day
for the Word <span class="spread">VAST</span> to become it well? Doctor <em>Littleton</em>
in his Dictionary makes <span class="spread">VAST</span> to be <em>huge</em>, <em>burly</em>,
<em>wide</em>, <em>broad</em>, <em>large</em>, and what is much less for the Archdeacon's
Purpose, <em>misshapen</em>, <em>ill-favoured</em>, <em>desolate</em>, <em>insatiable</em>,
<em>outragious</em>; put Day to ever a one of them, and see
how the Coat fits. Mr. <em>Bailey</em> in his very good Dictionary
is contented with two or three Interpretations only, as a
<em>huge Day</em>, a <em>spacious Day</em>. <em>Ludlow</em>, I believe, would
have followed <em>Littleton</em>, and then for <span class="spread">VAST</span> would
have understood <em>desolate Day</em>, <em>ill-shapen Day</em>, <em>insatiable
Day</em>; so dangerous is it for People to meddle with
Words which they do not understand. Of all the Blunders
in Expression which are to be avoided, there was
the best Provision made against this that could be, if a
Man had had the least Acquaintance with the politer
Authors, Monsieur St. <em>Evremont</em> having written a Dissertation
on this very Word <span class="spread">VAST</span>, and whoever reads it,
will pity a Writer who could fall into so gross an Errour, if
there were no Malice in what he had written. I suppose
that almost all Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s Readers have taken this
<span class="spread">VAST</span> in the Sense he intended for <em>Important</em>, and if
he had said this <em>Mountainous Day</em>, it would have done
as well: They would have expected a Birth from the
Mountain, and the Arch-Deacon's History is a Labour of
the same Kind.</p>

<p>As we in <em>England</em> are apt to confound Sentiments and
Expressions, so we do the same by Talents, and think if
a Man can make a <em>School-Book</em> or two, he can write a
History. <em>Jeremiah Collier</em> wrote a <em>short View of the Stage</em>,
which sold wonderfully, and immediately the Booksellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hir'd him to write Three Histories in Folio: And I question
not but, because Sir <em>Isaac Newton</em> has outdone all Philosophers
in his Treatise of <em>Fluxions</em>, they would employ him
in <em>Heroick</em> Poetry, if he were young enough, and would
be employ'd by them. There was a <em>Pertness</em> in <em>Collier</em>'s
Stile, which was mistaken for Vivacity, and tho' there
cannot be any Thing more affected, yet it recommends his
<em>Essays</em>, <em>Views</em>, &amp;c. as somewhat in the Perfection of our
Language. I wonder Dr. <em>Felton</em> should forget him, when
he mentions Sir <em>Roger L'Estrange</em>, Mr. <em>Trap</em>, and other
masterly Writers. You cannot name <em>Collier</em>'s <em>Views</em>,
<em>Essays</em>, &amp;c. in Company, but some body or other immediately
cries out, <span class="quotation">Ay! that's Fine.</span> Wonderful fine, as
will be seen presently.</p>

<p>In his Essays he has this Expression, <span class="quotation">A Man may act
an Excellency for the Satisfaction if Significancy</span>, which
has the same Effect in Prose, as it is observ'd of some
good Verses, that the <em>Smoothness</em> or <em>Roughness</em> of the Numbers
are an Image of the Roughness or Smoothness of the
Thing. You can hardly pronounce these Words without
a prim Look, and screwing up your Mouth with the Affectation
of a Girl at a <em>Boarding-School</em>. Would one imagine
that this was said by the same Author in another
place; <span class="quotation">Nothing is more nauseous than to be affected</span>: And
yet see further, <span class="quotation">Don't let Miss suffer her Heels to get too
much into her Head</span>, not to say any Thing about the <em>Attitude</em>,
which would be very extraordinary in a Picture.
Again, <span class="quotation">Seeing and Hearing are the most creditable Senses;
the Brain has an unpromising Aspect</span>, which cannot be
known without Dissection. What Idea does this leave
upon the Mind? or this, <em>A <span class="smcap">Prince</span> made but a lame Figure
in Comparison with our <span class="smcap">Apostle</span>.</em> One would think
<em>Collier</em> had Prince <em>Prettiman</em> and the <em>Spanish</em> Fryer in his
Head when he wrote it. He is so fond of this Conceit,
that he endeavours to prove, in his Essay on Theft, and
elsewhere, that our Saviour's Disciples were Men of Quality,
well-born, and well-bred, and if they did fish at any
time, 'twas only for their Pleasure. As the <em>Barber</em> of
<em>Northampton</em> told <em>Estcourt</em>, He was a Doctor by Profession,
and shav'd only for his Diversion. But <em>Collier</em> seems to
have less Regard for his Brotherhood in the last Centuries,
when he informs us that by Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>'s Injunctions
a Clergyman could not marry till he had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
his Complaint against Celibacy before two Justices of the
Peace, and gain'd their Consent, and the <span class="quotation">good Will of the
Master or Mistress where the Damsel serv'd</span>, by which he
gives us to understand, that soon after the Reformation
the Priests Wives were all <em>Abigail</em>'s.</p>

<p><em>Collier</em>'s Dialogues serve two principal Ends, the one
to carry on an Argument the more freely and loosely; and
the other, which is not the least, to give himself a fat
Figure in his own Picture, for he himself is the Man who
has always the best of the Dispute.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, I can't stand the Force of your Argument:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are smart, you have brought your self well off.<br /></span>

<p>Thus he conquers his <em>Alphius</em>, and compels him <span class="quotation">to
own, That the Priests are an independant State</span>; and
thus Boys build Houses of Cards to blow them down
when they have done. What a Parcel of Flowers and
Graces might one pick up in his Writings, if it was more
<em>a propos</em>, such as <em>Slender Difficulty</em>, <em>Lean Temper</em>,
<em>touchy Point</em>, <em>Cheek by Joule</em>, <em>to con over</em>, <em>to be Uppish</em>,
<em>Intents and Purposes</em>, <em>to glitter upon the Senses</em>, <em>Enrichments</em>,
<em>renverse</em>, <em>Deconcert</em>, <em>bigger Entertainment of the
Soul</em>, <em>don't</em>, <em>on't</em>, <em>can't</em>, <em>won't</em>, <em>'tis</em>, <em>it's</em>, <em>at's</em>, and the frequent
Use of Proverbs.</p>

<p>The Use of Proverbs is so far from giving Disgust in
common Conversation, especially in the Country, that
'tis look'd upon to be Wit as well as Mimickry, Buffoonry,
Pun, Quibble, <em>&amp;c.</em> and you would be star'd at if you
should object against either of them as the effect of Ignorance
or Folly. The <em>Spectator</em> takes Notice that Puns
made a considerable Figure on the Banks of <em>Cam</em>, and
Proverbs must needs do no less on the Banks of <em>Isis</em>, when
so great a Scholar as <em>Edward Llwyd</em> set the Example,
two in one Paragraph.</p>

to <em>Collier</em>'s huddling of Metaphors, a Vice in Eloquence
which is hardly taken Notice of in <em>English</em> Writings; <span class="quotation">To
be always pouring in Oil, is the Way to overset the Flame
and extinguish the Lamp: If you lay a Country constantly
under Water, you must spoil the Soil.</span> Here Fire and
Water most lovingly agree together to do the same Business.
<span class="quotation">To overset a Flame</span> is a fine Way of speaking, and
as easily to be conceiv'd, as to overset a Cockboat or a
<em>Wherry</em>. Again, <span class="quotation">I fancy we shall sift the Gentleman to

same short Sentence. If the Writer or Reader's Head can
be clear under such Operations, it will be a Wonder. The

and judicious: <span class="quotation">Thus I have known a Heroe compar'd to a

but by bad Management it hath so happen'd, that the
<em>Thunder-bolt</em> hath overflow'd the Banks, the <em>Lion</em> has
been darted through the Skie, and the Billows have roll'd
not of the <em>Lybian</em> Desart</span>; neither of which is so bad as
<em>Collier</em>'s burning and drowning the same Thing at the
same Time.</p>

<p>The <em>Declamatory</em> Stile, another great Vice in Eloquence,
is the Characteristick of these <em>Essays</em>; tho' I question not
but it is thought to be the very Cream of the Discourse.
If 'tis excuseable any where it is in Country Pulpits,
where, if a Parcel of Words are well put together, we
should not be too scrupulous about the Sense. <span class="quotation">Then Commerce
must give way to Religion, Baptism sway the Indenture,
and the Gospel govern the <em>Exchange</em>.</span> Are not
the Gospel, Baptism, and Religion, the Exchange, Indenture,
and Commerce, the same Things in the <em>Contrast</em>.
I am far from affecting a foreign Word when we
have as good a one of our own, much less when we have
a better; and <em>Attitude</em> and <em>Contrast</em> may be supplied by
<em>Posture</em> and <em>Opposition</em>, if the Reader pleases; out the
former was used for Decorum sake, the idea being too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
gross when in an <em>English</em> Dress. The Author is again
declaiming: <span class="quotation">It may be the Failing of Drunkenness is imperceptible
in the single Instance, 'twill rise in the Sum</span>;
<span class="quotation">To go always a little out of the Way makes a strange Mistake
upon the progress</span>; <span class="quotation">A Grain will grew to a Burthen
by Addition</span>; <span class="quotation">To be always dipping an Estate, is the Way
to turn Beggar</span>; <span class="quotation">A Drop that's perpetually pelting Will
make a Stone give way.</span> How new, how eloquent is all
this, and that which comes after! He is preaching to
the Booksellers about selling <span class="quotation">Arian Books, Sceptical
Books, Books of Divorce, Impotence, <em>&amp;c.</em> Whatever they
think on't, <em>Atheism</em> and <em>Lewdness</em> is the most fatal Mortality;&mdash;The
Plague of the Heart the most frightful Distemper&mdash;Infection
is safer lodged in the Veins, than in the Will&mdash;A
Man had much better be poyson'd in his Blood,

as a Boar pisses it comes by Spirts. Again, <span class="quotation">Are we never
to do any Thing without a Majority; If we are govern'd
by Numbers, we shall live strangely; If you go to
Poll, Sense and Conscience will lose it in most Cases.</span> Of all
the Modern Criticks, who have given us Rules, Dr. <em>Felton</em>
upon the <em>Classicks</em> is the Author, who seems to have
stood most upon his own Legs: Others have learnt much
of the <em>French</em>, and have been much blam'd for it by
those who have and have not read their Books. <em>Rymer</em>
confesses the <em>French</em> began the <em>Art</em> of <em>Criticism</em> among
the Moderns: <span class="quotation">They fell not to it in earnest</span>, says he, in
his Preface to <em>Rapin</em>, <span class="quotation">till the <em>Royal Academy</em> was founded,
<em>and</em> Cardinal <em>Richelieu</em> encourag'd and rally'd all the
scatter'd Wits under his Banner: Then <em>Malherbe</em> reform'd
their ancient licentious Poetry.</span> <em>Malherbe</em> died Seven
Years before the <em>Royal Academy</em> was thought of; however
he did begin the Reformation of the <em>French</em> Poetry,
and was happily follow'd by <em>Voiture</em>, <em>Sarazin</em>, <em>Maynard</em>,
<em>Godeau</em>, &amp;c. The <em>Academy</em> have indeed assum'd to themselves
the sole Glory of refining the <em>French</em> Tongue, tho'
they can by no means engross the Merit of it. <em>Malherbe</em>
began it before they had a Being, and several eminent
<em>French</em> Authors have written since, who were not of the
<em>Academy</em>, as St. <em>Evremont</em>, <em>Menage</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> But there's something
pleasant in the Complements that are paid to it, and
the <em>Antiquaries</em> have found out just such another Society
in <em>Rome</em>, under the Patronage of <em>Augustus</em>, to refine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<em>Roman</em> Language, which, by the way, had been refined
before by <em>Terence</em>, <em>Lucretius</em>, <em>Cicero</em>, <em>Hortensius</em>, and their
Contemporaries, at the latter End of the Republick. The
Learned Antiquaries go so far as to name the <em>Roman Academicians</em>,</p>

<blockquote><p>
<em>Mecænas</em>,<br />
<em>Pollio</em>,<br />
<em>Plotius</em>, <em>Valgius</em>,<br />
The Two <em>Messala's</em>,<br />
The Two <em>Bibulus's</em>,<br />
<em>Piso</em>, the Father,<br />
<em>Servius</em>, <em>Fulvius</em>,<br />
<em>Tibullus</em>,<br />
<em>Horace</em>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Ovid</em> perhaps was left out because he was in Exile at
<em>Tomos</em>; but why could they not have put in <em>Livy</em>, <em>Propertius</em>,
&amp;c. They have given this Academy, the Temple
and Library of <em>Apollo</em>, to meet and study in, and it
is pretended, that <em>Horace</em>'s Epistle to the <em>Piso's</em> was written
by Direction of the Academy, and if there had ever
been such an Academy at all, one might the sooner have
given Credit to it. The <em>French</em> Academy set an Example
to other learned and ingenious Men, to make themselves
Masters of their own Language, and the Encouragement
they met with from <em>Lewis</em> XIV produced an
Age of Poets, Orators, and Criticks. The latter have
done more towards explaining the <em>Classicks</em> than had been
done before from the <em>Augustan</em> Age to their own.
They threw Pedantry and Jargon out of their Writings,
and render'd them as polite as judicious. Such are the
Criticisms of <em>Rapin</em>, <em>Bossu</em>, <em>Segrais</em>, <em>Boileau</em>, <em>Bouhours</em>,
and <em>Dacier</em>, who are all read with like Profit and Pleasure;
and this is the Reason of the frequent Use of
them, and not an Affectation of foreign Phrases, and technical
Cant, as is insinuated by such as never read, or
never understood them, and by such too as have not
only both read and understood them, but have learnt of
them all the Reading they have, and yet make use of no
other Names than <em>Quintillian</em>, <em>Longinus</em>, <em>Donatus</em>, <em>Eustathius</em>,
and the Ancients. This is very common, and
I could easily prove it upon those who have charg'd
others with Ignorance and Illiterature. The Reading
<em>French</em> Authors is inconceivably beneficial to such as do
not understand <em>Latin</em> so well as Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, and <em>Greek</em>
so well as Mr. <em>Pope</em>: They will learn as much of the
<em>Greek</em> History from <em>Ablancourt</em>'s <em>Thucydides</em>, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<em>Latin</em> from <em>Du Ryer</em>'s <em>Livy</em>, as they could from the Originals.
And as to the Poets, they had better read Madam
<em>Dacier</em>'s <em>Homer</em>, and <em>Segrais</em>'s <em>Virgil</em>, which they
do understand, than the Original <em>Homer</em> and <em>Virgil</em>
which they do not. My Lord <em>Roscommon</em> owns of the
<em>French</em>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The choicest Books that <em>Rome</em> or <em>Greece</em> have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their excellent Translators made their own.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And tho' in all Translations the Spirit and Beauty of
the Original must in a great measure be lost by Transfusion,
yet in History especially you are sure to have the
Method, the Facts, and the Politicks, tho' you have not
the Strength and Ellegance of the Style. <em>Dryden</em> tells
the late Duke of <em>Bucks</em>, in the Dedication to his <em>Virgil</em>;
<span class="quotation">Impartially Speaking, the <em>French</em> are as much better Criticks,
as they are worse Poets.</span> The Latter is incontestable;
and not to mention <em>Milton</em>, who is above all Parallel.
They have nothing of <em>Epick</em> Poetry so good as our King
<em>Arthur</em>; neither are their <em>Corneille</em> and <em>Racine</em> a Match
for our <em>Shakespear</em> and <em>Otway</em>. They have no Body to
name against <em>Wycherley</em>, <em>Etherege</em>, <em>Shadwel</em>, <em>Congreve</em>,
<em>Vanburgh</em>, <em>Steel</em>. <em>Moliere</em>, the best of their Comick Poets,
could write <em>Scapius</em>, <em>Dandins</em>, <em>Sganarelles</em>, and all Kinds
of Farce perfectly well; but for Wit and Humour, Repartee,
Polite Conversation, for what the Criticks call the
<em>Vis Comica</em>, you must have recourse to the <em>English</em> Comedies,
if you would know what it is. A <em>French Marquis</em>,
as <em>Moliere</em> shew'd him upon his Stage, would only make
a very good Taylor upon ours. They have no <em>Hopkins</em>
for Elegy, no <em>Philips</em> for Pastoral: <em>Scarron</em> will hardly
serve for a <em>Ralpho</em> to our <em>Hudibras</em>. In the <em>Ode</em>, I think,
<em>Malherbe</em> is at least equal to <em>Cowley</em>, and <em>Voiture</em> and <em>Sarazin</em>
are not behind our <em>Suckling</em> and <em>Waller</em>, in the
gallant Way: Nor is our <em>Prior</em> behind their <em>La Fontaine</em>
for Taletelling. On the other Hand, I am afraid we
must allow, that we have no Translation in <em>English</em> equal
to <em>Seagrais</em>'s <em>Virgil</em> for Intelligence of the Original, and a
correct as well as harmonious Diction, especially if the
Character given of it by <em>Ruæus</em> is just. Did we look into
other Sciences, we should find our selves more than a
Match for them; What Names have they to set against
our <em>Newton</em> and <em>Halley</em> in the Mathematicks, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<em>Sydenham</em> and <em>Willis</em> in <em>Physick</em>. They have no <em>Bacon</em>,
no <em>Boyle</em> in Philosophy. In History indeed they have a
<em>Varillas</em> and a <em>Maimbourg</em> for our <em>Nelson</em> and <em>Brady</em>, and
doubtless the Royal Historiographers will, in the History
of <em>Lewis</em> XIV, come up to the <em>Grand Rebellion</em>, and Mr.
<em>Echard</em>'s History for Impartiality and Truth. If I were
a <em>Frenchman</em> I should make a Start here, and cry out,
What is their <em>Tureune</em> and their <em>Conde</em> to our <em>Marlborough</em>,
and their Great <em>Monarch</em>, who took Pleasure in
Slaughter and Devastation, to our Glorious King <em>George</em>,
whose only Care and Delight is to maintain Liberty and
Peace.</p>

<p>Dr. <em>Felton</em> declares we began to refine our Language
much sooner than the <em>French</em>, and that the Writers in
Queen <em>Elizabeth</em>'s Reign are far preferable to <em>Shakespear</em>,
<em>Fletcher</em>, <em>Waller</em>, <em>Suckling</em>, <em>May</em>, <em>Sands</em>, and all the Writers
from the <em>Gunpowder</em> Plot to the Restoration. He
will not be advis'd by the best Critick in Poetry, as he represents
him. Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, who speaking of <em>Beaumont</em>
and <em>Fletcher</em>, writes thus; <span class="quotation">I am apt to believe the <em>English</em>
Language in them arrived to its Perfection</span>: They
wrote between the Beginning of King <em>James</em> I and the
Reign of King <em>Charles</em> II, a Period in which Dr. <em>Felton</em>
makes the <em>English</em> Language to have declin'd; though,
if I were permitted to give Judgement, I should continue
the Improvement of our Tongue till the Time of the
<em>Spectator</em>, and the Translation of <em>Homer</em>, where, I think,
it is in the greatest Purity and Elegance, and that one of
the first deplorable Signs of its Declension was even the
Discourse upon the <em>Classicks</em>. <em>Dryden</em> himself continues
the good Taste till the Opening of the Long Parliament
1640, when, if you'l believe him, the Muses were struck
dead at a Blow, abandon'd to a barbarous Race of Men,
Enemies of all good Learning, such as <em>Selden</em>, <em>Whitlock</em>,
<em>Bathurst</em>, <em>Wilkins</em>, and the immortal <em>Milton</em>. This
Passage should have been transplanted into the two famous
Histories of those Times, publish'd since King
<em>William</em>'s Death, particularly that of the <em>Grand Rebellion</em>,
which Dr. <em>Felton</em> protests is the most impartial one
that ever was written; but it is very well it does not stand
in need of his Certificate, for there would have been
great Exception taken against his Authority. As good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
a Word as the Doctor gives Mr. <em>Dryden</em> as a <em>Critick</em>,
<em>Dryden</em> out-does him in his own Panegyrick.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let <em>Dryden</em> with new Rules our Stage refine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his great Models form by this Design.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Piece of Modesty in Verse is excelled by another
in Prose; <span class="quotation">Our present Poets, <em>himself the Top of them</em>,
have far surpast all the antient and modern Writers of
other Countries.</span></p>

<p>Thus has he put himself above <em>Homer</em>, <em>Sophocles</em>, <em>Virgil</em>,
<em>Horace</em>, <em>Corneille</em>, <em>Racine</em>, <em>Boileau</em>, &amp;c. Notwithstanding
we were so happy in Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s Criticisms,
Doctor <em>Felton</em> is of Opinion the Art is not brought enough
to Perfection among us; and therefore earnestly
sollicites Sir <em>Richard Steel</em> to write Comments upon <em>Homer</em>
and <em>Virgil</em>, as Mr. <em>Addison</em> has done upon <em>Milton</em>.
I am satisfied Sir <em>Richard Steel</em> did not keep his Countenance
if ever that Passage of the Doctor's came in his
Way. I will not say the same of Mr. <em>Trap</em>, who, they
tell me, is a Poet by his Place, or a <em>made</em> Poet, better by
half than one born so; but if Doctor <em>Felton</em> had foreseen
that the ingenious Gentleman would have came off
as He did with <em>Virgil</em>, and in what a sad Place Doctor
<em>Swift</em> would find his Translation, I believe he would have
postpon'd the Encomium, <span class="quotation">What a polite Critick may do
if he pleases</span>, says the Doctor, <span class="quotation">and in how different an
Aspect <em>Criticism</em> appears, when formed by Men of Parts
and Fire, we may see in Mr. <em>Trap</em></span>; and the Encomium
continues for a Page or two: But the aforesaid Translation
having cut the Matter short, I will repeat no more
of it.</p>

<p><em>Cowley</em> was in as great Vogue 60 or seventy Years ago,
as any Composer or Translater of our Time has been,
and Doctor <em>Felton</em> without knowing that his Character is
worn, informs us, that his <em>Davideis</em> is as good an Epick
Poem as the <em>Ilias</em>, that his Lyricks are as good as <em>Pindar</em>'s
or <em>Horace</em>'s, that he wrote Elegies as well as <em>Tibullus</em>,
Epistles as well as <em>Ovid</em>, Pastorals as well as <em>Theocritus</em>;
and that his <em>Cutter of Colmanstreet</em> is as good a Comedy
as the <em>Adelphi of Terence</em>. The Doctor's own Words are;
<span class="quotation">He rivalled the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em> Poets in every Thing
but Tragedy.</span> His saying so is the more remarkable, for
that he had seen the Preface to <em>Dryden</em>'s Fables, wherein
that incomparable Critick, as he terms him, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<em>Cowley</em> is sunk in his Reputation, and the late Duke of
<em>Bucks</em> in his Essay acknowledges as much:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Cowley</em> might boast to have perform'd his Part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he with Nature joyn'd the Rules of Art:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ill Expression gives sometimes Allay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To noble Thoughts&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' All appears in Heat and Fury done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Language still must soft and easy run.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Doctor <em>Felton</em> in Praise of Criticism tells us, with equal
Elegance and Perspicuity, <span class="quotation">If the Rules had not been
given, we had not been troubled with <em>many fewer</em> Writers:</span>
And in the Pursuit of his own excellent Work, he
declares, <span class="quotation">He has tempered the <em>Briskness</em> of Thought with
the Sedateness of Judgement.</span> The <em>French</em> have their <em>Pensees
Brusques</em>, but the Doctor could not fall so low as that.
<em>Brusque</em> signifying <em>blunt</em>, <em>rash</em>, and the like. This <em>Briskness</em>
is, I suppose, more agreeable to the Conception of
a certain Bookseller, who being written to by a certain
Squire for a <em>brisk History</em>, sent him by the next Carrier
that of <em>Don Quixot</em>. This was thirty Years ago, before
we were so well furnished with <em>brisk Histories</em> as we have
been since.</p>

<p>I take <em>brisk</em> in our Tongue to be to <em>lively</em>, as <em>pert</em> is
to <em>witty</em>: But I cannot depend on my own Judgement;
the Translator of <em>Homer</em> having used <em>Briskness</em> in the
same Sense as Doctor <em>Felton</em> uses it: <span class="quotation">Heaven and Earth
became engaged in the Subject, by which it rises to a great
Importance, and is hastened forward into the briskest
Scenes of Action.</span> If that Author could bear the least
Objection to any Thing that belongs to him, I would
ask the Reader whether he does not fancy there is some
Affectation in the Expression. But let that pass; if we
are rightly informed, the Word <em>Brisk</em> is in the <em>Teutonick
Friesch</em>, which is in plain English <em>Frisk</em>, and then for
the Gods and Demi-gods to frisk up and down the Field
of Action, or the Doctor to frisk up and down his Closet
is very indecorous. The Duke of <em>Buckingham</em> in the <em>Rehearsal</em>
seems to take <em>Brisk</em> in the latter Sense, as when
Thunder and Lightning act their Parts on the Stage.
The former says, I am the <em>bold Thunder</em>, the latter the
<em>brisk Lightning I</em>. And not at all to derogate from the
Character of Lightning, which has been so serviceable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
all Sorts of Poetry and Poets, I cannot help confirming
my Opinion by a very common Simile, and saying <span class="quotation">As
brisk as bottled Ale</span>.</p>

<p>Among all the Refiners of our Tongue, 'tis the vulgar
Notion, that Sir <em>Roger L'Estrange</em> was most eminent.
True it is, Doctor <em>Felton</em> owns he was good for
nothing but <em>Banter</em> and <em>Railing</em>; for that is what we in
<em>England</em> generally mean by Raillery. Tho' <em>Smith</em> and
<em>Johnson</em> in the <em>Rehearsal</em> are not the most lively Characters;
yet their Dialogue with <em>Bayes</em> is what the <em>French</em>
call <em>Raillery</em>. We in <em>England</em> do mean very often the
Dialogue of <em>Billinsgate</em>, where it is common enough to hear
one Fish-Woman cry to another, <span class="quotation">No more of your Raillery</span>,
which is there the worst Sort of Railling; and for that
and Banter the Doctor assures us <em>L'Estrange</em> was most
proper. The same say I, and that he understood no more
of true Eloquence than he did of <em>Greek</em>, out of which
the Booksellers hired him to translate <em>Josephus</em>, and he
did it from the <em>French</em> Translation. The Philosopher <em>Seneca</em>'s
Works he pretended to translate from the <em>Latin</em>,
and I wish Mr. <em>Trap</em> would translate the following Phrases
in his <em>Seneca</em>'s <em>Morals</em> back into that Tongue again,
<span class="quotation">One good Turn is the shoeing Horn to another.</span> <span class="quotation">He does
me Good in spite of my Teeth.</span> <span class="quotation">After a Matter of eight
Years</span>; and this into <em>Greek</em> for <em>Esop</em>'s Fables, The <span class="quotation">Moon
was in a heavy Twitter</span>: Yet I'm satisfied these fine
Sayings are some of those that gained him the Reputation
of being a polite Writer of <em>English</em>: I have heard
that about the Moon very much commended, which
shews that we are not sufficiently sensible how mean
Words debase a Thought. <span class="quotation">There's nothing</span>, says <em>Boileau</em>,
<span class="quotation">which debases a Discourse more than mean Words.
A mean Thought exprest in noble Terms, is generally
better than the most noble Thoughts exprest in mean
Terms.</span> I know no greater Instance of the ill Effect of
mean Terms, than what we find in two Verses of Mr.
<em>Montague</em>'s Epistle to the Lord <em>Dorset</em> on King <em>William</em>'s
Victory at the <em>Boyne</em>. 'Tis in the greatest Heat
of that glorious Action, and in the Middle of the <em>Sublime</em>,
which is not wanting in that Poem.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Philips</em>'s Poems, the <em>splendid Shilling</em> and <em>Cyder</em>,
are full of Instances where mean Thoughts are raised by
noble Expressions, and they are wonderfully pleasing; as
in <em>Cyder</em>; this of the <em>Pear-Tree</em>.</p>

<p>I have never met with any Author who so happily imitated
the manner and stile of <em>Milton</em> as <em>Philips</em> has done,
and there seems to be hardly any other Difference than
that of the Subjects they wrote of.</p>

<p>What I have quoted out of <em>L'Estrange</em> is nothing to
the Delicacy of a modern Writer of Plays, who without
Wit, Language, Learning, or Manners, wrote three or four
Farces, which took as much as <em>Pradon</em>'s in <em>France</em>; but
the <em>English</em> have not recollected themselves so soon as
the <em>French</em> did; for <em>Pradon</em> out-liv'd the Vogue he was
in, and became a greater Jest than ever he had made.
What think ye of our Poet's Delicacy and Wit, who in a
gallant Letter to his Mistress, tells her, <span class="quotation">He's gall'd with
riding, Love is forging Darts in his Belly; he's a Dog
in a Doublet</span>, &amp;c. There's a deal of graver Nonsense
with it, but it being mostly <em>Blasphemy</em>, I dare not repeat
it. This Author had his Portion of temporary
Fame. <em>Ogilvy</em> had his Day, and <em>Dryden</em> says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fame, like a little Mistress of the Town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gain'd with Ease; but then she's lost as soon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>However, as long as the Credit lasts, these temporary Authors
bear the Port of the greatest Genius, are clapt
and star'd at, as those Merchants who are driving in their
Coaches to Bankrupcy, have generally the best Equipage.
What are become of the <em>Marots</em>, the <em>Ronsards</em>,
the <em>Scuderies</em> of our neighbour Nation, yet these Writers
were infinitely superiour to what most of our taking
Authors have been. Could any Body have thought
that Sir <em>Richard Baker</em>'s Chronicle would ever have past
from the Justice's Hall Window to the Butler's Cellar, or
that <em>Cowley</em>'s <em>Mistress</em> would have lost all her Charms in
thirty Years Time, and become a Cast-Off for City Prentices
and Lawyers Clerks, to say nothing of <em>Orinda</em>, <em>Flatman</em>,
&amp;c. Yet these Writers were Originals which raises
their Merit much above all Sorts of Translators, and it
ought to be a Lesson to all Poets and Historians, whether
first Hand or second Hand, to pay the World for
their Applause with Modesty, which is the surest Way
to keep it in a good Humour; <span class="quotation">Since 'tis Posterity only</span>,
says <em>Boileau</em>, <span class="quotation">which sets a Value upon all Writings, you
must not, as admirable as you take a modern Author to
be, presently put him upon a Level with those Writers
who have been admired for so many Ages, because one cannot
be sure his Works will pass with Glory to the next.
Indeed without going far for Examples, How many Authors
have we seen admired in our Age, whose Glory is
vanished in a very few Years. How were <em>Balzac</em>'s Works
admired thirty Tears ago?</span> So much that Cardinal <em>Richelieu</em>
at the same Time that he was meditating the universal
Monarchy for the Crown of <em>France</em>, wrote in Vindication
of them. The Bishop of <em>Rochester</em> did the
same for <em>Cowley</em>; but neither the Cardinal nor the Bishop
could defend them from the Fate of all Temporary
Authors. Neither <em>Cowley</em> nor <em>Balzac</em> are now any more
mentioned in <em>France</em> or <em>England</em>. And the main Reason
why they lost their Credit was for want of duly considering
what their particular Talents were adapted to;
for that they had both very great Talents is universally
acknowledged, <span class="quotation">Mons. de <em>Balzac</em> a passe toute sa vie a
ecrire des lettres, dont il n'a jamais pu attraper le veritable
Charectere. <em>Balzac</em> spent all his Time in writing
Letters, but could never hit the true Character.</span> <em>Cowley</em>
applied himself to Poetry, and never enough knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Power and Harmony of Numbers. He had a great deal
too much Wit to charm his Mistress with his Passion.
Very few of us are let into this Secret. We cannot believe
that a Poet can have too much Wit, and indeed
the Offence given that Way is not very common. The
last Duke of <em>Bucks</em> rightly instructs us:</p>

<p>Again,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That silly Thing we call sheer Wit avoid.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This probably was a Rebuke to the Author of the
<em>Plain-Dealer</em> and <em>Country-Wife</em>, who has transgressed
in this kind as much as any Body, and was the best
able to do it. The Author of the <em>Relapse</em> is not entirely
free from this Censure, nor the Authors of <em>Love for
Love</em>, and the <em>Funeral</em>. But it will not be more surprising
than it is true, that <em>Peter Motteux</em> declared he had
taken a great deal of pains with a Character in a Farce
of his, to bring it within the Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>'s
Rule in those Places where he told me he had given it
too much Wit. Mr. <em>Walsh</em>, one of the greatest Criticks
of our Nation, observes, that the Softness, Tenderness, and
Violence of Passion, are wanting in Mr. <em>Cowley</em>'s Love
Verses, insomuch that he <span class="quotation">could hardly fancy he was in
Love when he wrote them</span>. <em>Pref.</em> to <em>Lett.</em> Yet there
were Variety and Learning enough in them, and more
Wit than in all our witty Poets since the Restoration,
excepting those above-mentioned. Mr. <em>Wycherly</em>, who
wrote as good Comedies as any in the <em>English</em>, or any
other Tongue, did not value himself so much upon them
as on a Folio of as bad Verses as any. <em>Creech</em> having had
Success in <em>Lucretius</em>, was put upon translating <em>Horace</em>,
and it is said by <em>Dryden</em>, that he might lose so much
of his Reputation, as to prevent Rivalship. Nay, <em>Butler</em>,
tho' he knew the Follies of Mankind so perfectly
well, did not perceive that there is no greater Folly
than to undertake what one is not fit for, and was persuaded
to let <em>Hudibras</em> translate <em>Ovid</em>. On this Rock
many Authors have split, who would have succeeded had
they consulted their Talents, and taken the right Course:
but it is a general Maxim with us in <em>England</em>, Verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
are Verses. He that can write one Thing, can write another,
and till our Taste is so refined, that we can distinguish
the Good and the Bad in the various Kinds of
Thinking, Writers will not be at the Pains to consult
their Talents, but content themselves with pleasing their
own Fancy, or that of the Publick, by which Means,
like Flies, they make a buzzing for a Day or two, and
are forgotten for ever. The <em>Spectator</em> very judiciously animadverts
on this Weakness: <span class="quotation">Our general Taste in <em>England</em>
is for Epigram, Turns of Wit, and forced Conceits,
which have no manner of Influence, either for the bettering
or enlarging the Mind of him who reads them,
and have been carefully avoided by the greatest Writers,
both among the Antients and Moderns.</span> He adds after
Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, <span class="quotation">The Taste of most of our <em>English</em> Poets is extreamly
<em>Gothick</em>, which I have endeavoured to banish in
several of my Speculations</span>.</p>

<p>Another remarkable Observation of Dr. <em>Felton</em>'s is, that
the <span class="quotation">best Performers are the best Judges</span>. He has only
<em>Horace</em> against him of the Antients, and <em>Dacier</em> of the
Moderns, as is already observed in this Essay. I believe
no Body will deny, but Mr. <em>Walsh</em> before-mentioned was
one of our best Judges of Regularity and Wit, yet hardly
any Body will say he was one of our best Performers. There's
nothing more common with small Genius's and small Judges,
than to demand of all Criticks <em>to write themselves</em> before
they criticise upon others Writings. They would stare if it
should be said, that <em>Dursey</em> knew no more of Poetry
than he did of Philosophy, nor of <em>English</em> than of <em>Hebrew</em>;
though it is very true, if it be understood of the
Art of Poetry, and the Beauty of Language; yet, that
he was a Performer, is I doubt not well known to the
Doctor, and well approved of. To teach us good Language
by Example, Dr. <em>Felton</em> expresses himself thus elegantly
and unaffectedly. <span class="quotation">When I wrote these Sheets, my
Lord <em>Landsdown</em>'s Poems lay dispersed up and down in
the Miscellanies; but some kind Hand</span>, as for Instance the
Bookseller, upon a very laudable Motive, <span class="quotation">hath assembled
those scattered Stars, and added another Lyre to the Constellation</span>;
which, though it is meant, to do singular Honour
to those Poems, must have an ill Effect in astronomical
Observations; it makes thirteen to the Dozen in the
twelve Houses, and must cause as much Confusion, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
two Signs of the Harp in a short Lane. The Modesty
of the following Passage adds as much to its Merit as to
the Truth of it: <span class="quotation">If I offered any Thing which is not
commonly observed, I hope it will not be interpreted any
Singularity, but such as may render your Lordship more
eminent and distinguished in the World</span>; and having taught
his noble Pupil what he should imitate, he gives him
warning what he should avoid, and that is the Reading
any Thing written by a <em>Presbyterian</em>: <span class="quotation">What crude indigested
Volumes! How many tedious Sheets without Argument
or Consistency, are the Writings of some of the <em>Dissenters</em>!</span>
whom does he mean, such as <em>Bates</em>, <em>Manton</em>,
<em>How</em>, <em>Pool</em>, <em>Clarkson</em>, <em>Alsop</em>, &amp;c. He and some other
good Church-Criticks make <em>Presbyterianism</em> to be a Sort
of <em>Hellebore</em>, if you do but snuff it up in your Nose you
run mad immediately. Thence it is, that the <em>Presbyterians</em>
are termed <em>Fanatici</em>, by the learned and sober
Writers of our two famous Universities. Is it expected,
that every Orthodox Doctor should know as much as
Bishop <em>Stillingfleet</em>, or write as well as Archbishop <em>Tillotson</em>?
Where is the Reason or Justice of censuring a
Body of Men for the Enthusiasm and Ignorance of a few?
Would this Doctor suffer the Tables to be turn'd, and a
Judgement to be made of the Writings of good Church-men,
by the Argument and Consistency of the Works, with
which the learned World are obliged by those of the Country
Clergy, whose Pieces can crawl to the Press, whether in
Prose or Verse, Meditations or Hymns. I do verily believe
he did not think of Dr. <em>Bates</em>, when he fell thus furiously
on Dissenters, or had ever seen any of his Writings, which
are as polite as the Politest of our Age; the Sentiments as
pious, as great, as noble, and as just, according to the
Subject, and the Language as pure and as harmonious.
What can be more so, than this Passage of his <em>Harmony
of the divine Attributes</em>, speaking of the Fall of <em>Adam</em>:
<em>Prodigious Pride! He was scarce out of the State of Nothing,
no sooner created but he aspired to be as God; not
content with his Image, he would rob God of his Eternity
to live without End; of his Sovereignty to command without
Dependance; of his Wisdom to know all Things without
Reserve. Infinite Insolence! that Man the Son of
Earth, forgetful of his Original, should usurp the Prerogatives,
which are essential to the Deity, and set himself up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a real Idol, was a Strain of the same Arrogancy which
corrupted the Angels.</em> This is what Dr. <em>Felton</em> calls <em>Presbyterian
Crudity</em>. It is strange, but it is true, that there
is a Narrowness of Soul, and a Conceit in some of our
Ecclesiasticks founded on the Establishment which we do
not meet with in others; nay, not in those who pretend
to Supremacy and Infallibility. Father <em>Bouhours</em>, though
as zealous a Jesuit as any in <em>France</em>, yet had so just a
Notion of every one's Merit in polite Learning, that he
freely owns the Refinement of the <em>French</em> Tongue, and
the <em>French</em> Manners was owing to those of the reformed
Religion, even to <em>Presbyterians</em>. <span class="quotation">Nous devons aux dernieres
Heresies une partie de l'Embellissement de notre Langue, &amp;
de la politesse de notre Siecle.</span></p>

<p>And another <em>French</em> Bigot tells us; <span class="quotation">One of their Historians
has observed, that the pretended Reformers began to
speak well and write well, and were the First that shewed
their Way to others</span>. They were all of them <em>Presbyterians</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Parvos femando libellos</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Sucratis populumq; rudem amorcando parolis.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our <em>Staunch</em> Criticks will not allow, that a <em>Presbyterian</em>
ever had or could have any Wit or any Eloquence,
though it was only to make an ill Use of it. No, no
Body must be well-born or well-bred, that is without the
Pale. No Man must be brave, nor Woman beautiful.
The Men are all painted with cropt Hair, and the Women
with Forehead-Cloaths, unless they assent and consent.
No Wit, no Language, no Honour, nor any Thing
that's good, is to be had any more than Matrimony without
a Licence. <em>Vide Grand Rebellion</em>, and Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s
<em>History of England</em>.</p>

<p>I am so very well entertain'd with <em>Dryden</em>'s <em>Virgil</em>,
that I am glad to meet with any Excuse for his Translation;
and would allow Dr. <em>Felton</em>'s, that <span class="quotation">the Faults are to
be ascribed partly to some Defects of our Language</span>; if the
Doctor himself, a few Lines before, had not said of the
same Language, <span class="quotation">that it is capable of all the Beauty,
Strength, and Significancy of the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin</em></span>. The
Faults which have been generally found with <em>Dryden</em> as
to <em>Virgil</em>, have been his mistaking or altering the Sense of
the Original, and turning the <em>Epick</em> Stile into <em>Elegiack</em>.
I doubt not but the <em>English</em> Tongue has Expression for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<em>English</em> Sentiments, let them be ever so great and sublime;
but I may very well doubt whether it has Diction
equal to the Strength and Dignity of the <em>Ilias</em>, without
the Helps <em>Milton</em> made use of, as compounding of Words
and reviving some old Teutonicks, which would look very
uncouthly among the Softnesses and Gingles of our fine
Writers of late.</p>

<p>I wish the Doctor had explain'd how he would have
us to understand him, when he informs us, that to translate
well is more difficult than to write well; by which
he intimates, that to form a Fable for a great and important
Action, to mark the Characters with suitable Sentiments,
to conduct the One and maintain the Other with
Art and Elevation diversify'd with proper Episodes;
through such a Work as the <em>Ilias</em>, is so far from being
the principal Part of an <em>Epick</em> Poem that it is no Part
at all; for with all this the Translator has nothing to do.
The Labour and Merit of it, according to Dr. <em>Felton</em>,
consist in the Language and Verses, in finding Words to
express the Action and Sentiments, and to adorn those
Words with Numbers and Harmony. This is all that is
necessary in a Translation; and being also but some Parts
of the Original, it cannot be more difficult to do a Part
than to do the Whole. Can one suppose, that to write
such a History as Mr. <em>Echard</em>'s from printed Books, written
Books, from the Hearsay and Report of Men, Women
and Children, is more difficult than to contrive and write
such a One as the <em>Cassandra</em> of <em>Calprenade</em>? or in plain
<em>English</em>, that to invent and tell a Story, is much easier
than the bare telling it only? It needs no Reflection.
If the Version of <em>Homer</em> had been born when he wrote, he
must of Consequence have preferr'd it to the <em>Ilias</em>, which
would have cost the Translator's Modesty, as much as Sir
<em>Richard Steele</em>'s to be put upon a Comment on <em>Homer</em>
and <em>Virgil</em>. My Lord <em>Roscommon</em> has explain'd this Matter
to us sufficiently:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though Composition is the nobler Part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet good Translation is no easy Art.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Monsieur <em>Maucroix</em>, who translated <em>Cicero</em> into <em>French</em>,
writes thus of translating to Monsieur <em>Boileau</em>: <span class="quotation">You have
told me more than once, that Translation is not the Way to
Immortality</span>; and he excuses his meddling with it, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Account of his Want of Application and Knowledge:
As to Immortality it is to be question'd, whether that
was the main Thing our Translators had in View. It
will not be deny'd, but that <em>Dryden</em>'s Bookseller put him
upon translating <em>Virgil</em>, by the Temptation of so much a
Line. And other Undertakers pay well enough to make a
mortal Life a little comfortable, it is not much Matter
whether the Work be immortal or not. <em>Ogilby</em> however
is sure of Immortality; for though his Translations are
as dead as his Carcass, yet he will be remember'd in
good Satyr for the Badness of them. <span class="quotation">My Author</span>, says
Monsieur <em>Maucroix</em>, <span class="quotation">is learned for me, the Topicks are all
digested, the Inventing and Disposing are none of my Business;
I have nothing to do but to utter my self</span>. Which
Utterance is much more difficult, as Dr. <em>Felton</em> will have
it, than to study, to digest, to invent, to dispose, and to
utter too. I do not suppose, that a Man ever applied
himself to Translation, if he felt in himself any of the
heavenly Fire which animates a great Genius, or was ambitious
of Fame by the Merit of an Epick Poem. It
must be own'd, that Judgement is requisite in Translation
as well as Composition, not only to preserve the Spirit
of the Original, but also to make Choice of such a
One as the Translator may be best able to manage. Mr.
<em>Charles Hopkins</em> was Master of this Secret; and instead
of attempting <em>Homer</em> or <em>Virgil</em>, he contented himself with
<em>Ovid</em>, and succeeded to Admiration. <em>Hopkins</em> knew, that
the Manners and Sentiments in <em>Ovid</em> were natural and
universal, which must please in all Ages; whereas, but a very
few can relish the Quarrels and Battles, which are the
main Subject of the <em>Ilias</em>. The Learned have explained
to us, for what it is that our Adoration is due to <em>Homer</em>:
For the Unity and Greatness of his Fable, the Variety and
Dignity of his Characters, and his sublime Thought and
Expression; I dare not say Diction and Sentiments, because
the <em>Spectator</em> has disgraced the Use of technical
Terms, by calling it Cant; and supposing, that those
who use them, do it to disguise their Ignorance, and shew
their Vanity in critical Phrase.</p>

<p>I should be glad to know, which it is of all <em>Homer</em>'s
before-mention'd Excellencies, that has so delighted the
Ladies, and the Gentlemen who judge like Ladies; or
whether ever a One of those Excellencies has been at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
distinguished from the Other; or whether there is any
Possibility of expressing the Sublime of the <em>Greek</em> Tongue
in our Language. As to the Sentiments, which are a principal
Part of Epick Poetry, they may be translated; we
very probably think much after the same Manner the
<em>Greeks</em> did, though we do not speak so. The Passions
are the same in all humane Nature; and probably the
Expression of them, by so great a Master of our Tongue
as the Translator of <em>Homer</em>, may gain as much as it may
lose by the Translation. But the Mischief of it is, these
Sentiments are that Part of the <em>Ilias</em> which the Criticks
have made most bold with:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For who, without a Qualm, hath ever look'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On holy Garbage, though by <em>Homer</em> cook'd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose railing Heroes, and whose wounded gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make some suspect he snores as well as nods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I offend&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i22"><em>Roscom.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><em>Dormitat Homerus</em>; that <em>Homer</em> sometimes sleeps, was
said before by <em>Horace</em>. The <em>Spectator</em> informs us, that
<em>Homer</em> is censured by the Criticks, for his Defect as to
the Sentiments in several Parts of the <em>Ilias</em> and <em>Odysses</em>.
However, it is most certain, that the Translation of <em>Homer</em>
must have pleased Ladies and Gentlemen by these
very Sentiments, or by the Translator's beautiful Diction
and Versification. But then all the great Parts of Epick
Poetry are lost to them, especially those that depend on
the Dignity and Strength of Expression, which will not
be pretended to be entirely preserved in the <em>English</em> Version.</p>

<p>Reading <em>Dacier</em> a few Days since, I was extreamly surprised
at a Criticism of his on a Translation of <em>Homer</em>,
by a much greater Critick than himself, even <em>Horace</em> his
Master, who has thus translated the Beginning of the
<em>Odyssey</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Dic mihi, Musa, virum, captæ post tempora Trojæ,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Qui mores Hominum Multorum vidit &amp; Urbes.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Muse, sing the Man, who after <em>Troy</em> was taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Manners of many Men and Cities saw.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>I have aimed to be literal here, the better to explain
<em>Dacier</em>'s Remarks. <span class="quotation">There are considerable Faults in this
Translation</span>, says Monsieur <em>Dacier</em>, <span class="quotation">he has forgotten the
Epithet &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#957;, which marks <em>Ulysses</em>'s Character; he
neglects the Circumstance that makes us most concern'd for
him, &#8005;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#955;&#945; &#960;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#952;&#951;, who wandered a long Time, he says
in a loose Way, after the Taking of <em>Troy</em>; whereas, it is
in <em>Homer</em> after having ruined <em>Troy</em></span>. Now, if <em>Horace</em>,
who had studied and admired <em>Homer</em> so much, as to make
him a Pattern for all future Writers of <em>Heroick</em> Poems,
could mistake three Times in translating two Lines, what
a Discouragement must it have been to those who knew
how he had succeeded in attempting it? 'Tis true, no
Poet will ever undertake a Translation with more Advantage
than the last Translator of <em>Homer</em> had; for besides
Eight or Ten Versions in <em>Latin</em>, <em>Italian</em>, <em>French</em>, &amp;c.
there are Three or Four in <em>English</em>; a Prose Translation
by Madam <em>Dacier</em>, and a Cart-load of Comments in all
Languages. I am satisfy'd so good a Versifyer as the
Translator of the <em>Ilias</em> might with those Helps, have
made a very good Translation, without understanding any
more <em>Greek</em> than my self; and nothing in the World
could have been more easy, than out of one Commentator
to have corrected another, and to have alter'd and amended
the Reading in the Name of any of the Criticks,
from <em>Eustathius</em> down to <em>Dacier</em>. I do not boast of being
Master of <em>Greek</em> enough to read <em>Homer</em> with so much
Pleasure in the Original as I could do in a good Version,
and it is much to be question'd, whether every one that
can read him in the Original do understand what they
read: Several Ladies and Gentlemen have subscribed for
<em>Chaucer</em> of the <em>Christ-Church</em> Edition, but I doubt very
much whether they understand him or not, and whether
a great many, who can read <em>Greek</em>, do really know what
they read. One of the greatest Masters of the <em>Greek
Tongue</em>, in our Time, has often question'd whether there
were Twenty Men in <em>England</em> who understood the
Strength, Beauty, and Elegance of that Language, tho'
there are a Thousand that pretend to it. He represented
it as a Study for a Man's Life, and I am confirm'd in
this Judgement by what <em>Menage</em> tells us of himself, and
others upon this Subject. 'Tis well known <em>Menage</em> wrote
several Things in <em>Greek</em>, particularly some Odes in Imi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>tation
of <em>Anacreon</em>, which are not thought inferiour to the
<em>Teian</em> Poet's; <span class="quotation">J'ay toujours fait beaucoup de cas de ceux
qui savent le grec</span>, &amp;c. <span class="quotation">He always highly valued those that
understood <em>Greek</em>.</span> He does not mean to construe and
parse it as Boys do at School, which is the most of what
we find in those who pretend to be Masters of it. <span class="quotation">Without
this Language</span>, continues he, <span class="quotation">a Man can't be said to
be more than half Learned: Monsieur <em>Cotelier</em>, Monsieur
de <em>Treville</em>, and Monsieur <em>Bigot</em>, are the only Men in
<em>France</em>, who can read the <em>Greek</em> Fathers in the Original.</span>
I suppose the Fathers are not so difficult as <em>Homer</em> with
respect to the Tongue at least; for the Language of Poetry
is peculiar to it, a made Language compounded and
metaphorical. If it be so, the Translation of the <em>Ilias</em>,
from the <em>Greek</em> of <em>Homer</em>, must shew the Translator to
be a greater Master of the <em>Greek</em> Language than all the
Learned Men in <em>France</em> except Three, and all the Learned
Men in <em>England</em> except about Twenty. For my own
Part, I confess, I make bold with all Kinds of Versions
to help me out in Originals, and am not asham'd to do
as <em>Menage</em> did; <span class="quotation">I own I do not understand <em>Pindar</em> enough</span>,
says he, <span class="quotation">to take Pleasure in him</span>. I have heard <em>Pindar</em>
quoted a Hundred Times by Persons who were very far
from being so modest as <em>Menage</em>, and fully satisfy'd
themselves that they understood him as well as the <em>Græcians</em>,
to whom he read his <em>Odes</em>, tho' I suspected the
contrary. <em>Menage</em>, again; <span class="quotation">I never read a <em>Greek</em> Author
without having before read the Translation</span>.</p>

<p>I do not insinuate any thing to depreciate the Translator
of <em>Homer</em>'s excellent Performance, which, as I have observ'd,
has the Merit of the most pure and harmonious
Diction and Versification; but to hint a little of the Confusion
of our Taste, and the Irregularity of our Judgement,
which like Things for Beauties which they have
not, and not for those which they have. Thus the Version
of <em>Homer</em> is lik'd as a Translation of the best <em>Epick</em>
Poem that ever was written, and not for the Softness and
Sweetness of the Elegy, which are every where to be
met with, as where the God <em>Apollo</em> appears in the Shape
of <em>Agenor</em>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>This is what the <em>French</em> call <em>Jeu des Mots</em>, playing
upon Words, and what <em>Dryden</em>'s <em>Virgil</em> is full of, tho' he
knew as well as any Body that it was a Fault: <span class="quotation">The Turn
of Thoughts, and Words</span>, says he, <span class="quotation">is the chief Talent of
the <em>French</em>; but the <em>Epick</em> Poem is too stately to receive
such little Ornaments</span>, which would have been in Perfection
in a Version of <em>Ovid</em>, and very little agrees with
<em>Waller</em> in his Epistle to my Lord <em>Roscommon</em>;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well sounding Verses are the Charm we use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heroick Thoughts, and Virtue to infuse:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We learn that Sound, as well as Sense, perswades.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In these Things our Taste is strangely confin'd: provided
the Verses run smoothly, and the Language is
soft and harmonious, we think it is fine: Let the Subject
be a <em>Boreas</em>, or a <em>Zephyr</em>: Nay, I do not question but the
Couplet I quoted out of the <em>English</em> <em>Homer</em> is reckon'd one
of the finest of the Version by Ladies, and Gentleman who
judge like Ladies, and who are the Nine in Ten of all
Readers of Poetry. I confess, I am much more pleas'd
with the following Verses, as rough and rumbling as they
are, because they participate of the Roughness of the
Thing which is imag'd to us,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jumping high o'er the Shrubs of the rough Ground,<br /></span>

<p>When such assimilating the Sound to the Sense is not
affected 'tis very agreeable; but when there is any Force
or Affectation in it, 'tis puerile and distasteful.</p>

<p>The following Description of the Poetical Fire, which
several Poets were enflam'd with, seems to be somewhat
deficient, and to want farther Explanation; especially
where the Translator tells us, <span class="smcap">Milton</span>'s Fire <span class="quotation">is like a
Furnace, but <em>Shakespear</em>'s like a Fire from Heaven</span>:
<span class="smcap">Virgil</span>'s like a <em>Kenning-Glass</em>, and <em>Lucan</em>'s and <em>Statius</em>'s
like <em>Lightning</em>. The <em>Kenning-Glass</em> should have
given me no Manner of Disturbance: But why is <em>Milton</em>'s
<em>Celestial Fire</em> compar'd to that which destroy'd the

voracious, consuming whatever is within its Reach. <em>Mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ton</em>'s
Fire, like that of the Sun, warms and enlivens; and
if ever any was fetch'd from Heaven, 'twas that, which
shines with so much radiant Brightness throughout his
whole Poem. I was the more shockt with this Misrepresentation
of <em>Milton</em>'s Fire, for that there's something
burlesque in the very Expression, a <em>Furnace</em>, and one
can't help being jealous that this Passage of <em>Hudibras</em>
might give the Hint for it.</p>

<p>Tho' I am very far from taking <em>Dryden</em> to be a perfect
Master of Criticism, yet I do not think his Deficiency
proceeded from Want of Judgement so much as from
Inconsistency and Vanity, and an Opinion that he was
Tyrant of <em>Parnassus</em>, and might govern by Will and
Pleasure instead of Law and Reason. I have observed
elsewhere that he adapts his Prefaces to the Circumstances
of every Play and Poem, and very often contradicts
in one what he had said in another: Nay, in his
Essay on <em>Dramatick Poetry</em>, the Contradiction is within a
few Lines of the Assertion, as thus; <span class="quotation">There is no Theater
in the World has any Thing so absurd as the <em>English
Tragi-Comedy</em></span>, which he confirms by this Verse;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Atq; ursem &amp; Pugiles media inter Carmina poscunt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And a little after; <span class="quotation">I cannot but conclude, to the Honour
of our Nation, that we have invented, encreased, and
perfected, a more pleasant Way of Writing than was ever
known to the Antients or Moderns of any Nation, which
is <em>Tragi-Comedy</em>. One of the most monstrous Inventions</span>,
says the <em>Spectator</em>, <span class="quotation">that ever enter'd into the Poet's
Thought. An Author might as well think of weaving the
Adventures of <em>Æneas</em> and <em>Hudibras</em> into one Poem, as of
writing such a motley Piece of Mirth and Sorrow</span>. Whatever
others thought of Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s Criticisms, he did
himself full Justice, and seem'd to despise all other Criticks
at the same Time that he laid himself most open to
them. <span class="quotation">These little Criticks do not well consider what the
Work of the Poet is, and what the Graces of a Poem;
the Story is the least Part of either.</span> Pref. to <em>Moch-Astrol.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Against him is every Critick, ancient and modern, from
<em>Aristotle</em> to <em>Rimer</em>, and more than all of them against
him is his own self. In another Place he writes thus;
<span class="quotation">The Fable is without doubt the chief Part of a Tragedy,
because it contains the Action, and the Action contains the
Happiness or Misery, which is the End of Tragedy. Without
the Fable the Poet, who had otherwise good Manners,
Sentiments, and Diction, would no more have made a
regular Poem, than a Painter would have made a
good Picture that had mingled Blue, Yellow, Red, and
other Colours confusedly together.</span> I do not mention these
Things to lessen Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s great Character as a
Poet; but to shew how well Dr. <em>Felton</em> could judge of it,
when he recommended him to us as a Critick. Against
Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, as to the <em>Story</em>, <em>is Rapin</em>, who he assures
us would <span class="quotation">be alone sufficient, were all other Criticks lost,
to teach a-new the Rules of Writing</span>. Against his <em>Rapin</em>
we find the Translator of <em>Homer</em> in an extraordinary
Manner in his Notes on the Fifth <em>Iliad</em>. I hope it did
not arise from any Resentment for that Jesuit's reflecting
on those Poets who seem to place the Essence of Poetry
in fine Language, and smooth Verse, to which he ascribes
its present Decay. <span class="quotation">As if the Art consisted only in Purity
and Exactness of Language: This indeed pleased well, and
was much to the Advantage of Women that had a Mind
to be tampering in Writing Verse: They found it their
Concern to give Vogue to this Kind of Writing, of which
they were as capable as the most Part of Men: For all
the Secret was no more than to make some little easy Verses,
in which they were content if they cou'd dress some soft
passionate Thoughts</span>, &amp;c. The most of our modern
Poets being interested in this Affair, I shall say no more
of it.</p>

<p>I have hinted more than once, that such Poets, and
their Admirers, almost always mistake Affectation for
Beauty, and I wonder the Translator of <em>Homer</em> should
give them the least Countenance by his Example; for I
am very much deceiv'd if there is a more affected Period
in the <em>English</em> Tongue than what follows: <span class="quotation">Nothing is
more lively <em>and Picturesque</em> than the <em>Attitude</em> of <em>Patroclus</em>
is describ'd in; The <em>Pathetick</em> of his Speech is finely
<em>contrasted</em> by the <em>Fierte</em> of <em>Achilles</em>.</span> Again, <span class="quotation">There's
something inexpressibly <em>riant</em> in the <em>Compartments of</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Achilles<em>'s Shield</em></span>. In the <em>Spectator</em>, N<sup>o</sup> 297. you read
thus: <span class="quotation">The last Fault which I shall take notice of in
Stile, is the frequent Use of <em>technical</em> Words or Terms of
Art</span>. The bringing in more <em>French</em> Words to soften and
enervate our Stile is of very ill Consequence. The
Translator, besides <em>Riant</em>, has also <em>Traits</em>, <em>ensanguin'd</em>,
&amp;c. I doubt, the Last is hardly a Word in any other
Language, and does not at all enrich our own. <em>Dryden</em>, in
an Epistle to the Earl of <em>Orrery</em>, has this Remark upon
it: <span class="quotation">I wish we might at length leave to borrow Words of
another Nation, which is now a Wontonness in us, not a
Necessity: But so long as some affect to speak, there will
not be wanting others, who will have the Boldness to write
them</span>.</p>

<p>If I might make Use of the Word <em>Contrast</em>, nothing
can be more so than Affectation and Simplicity; and the
Translator seems, either not to have a just Notion of the
Latter, or to have a very ill Opinion of it: For without
distinguishing between Simplicity and Negligence, he affirms,
<span class="quotation">That Simplicity is a Word of Disguise for a shameful
unpoetical Neglect of Expression</span>, he makes no Exception
in this general Charge. And thus one of the
greatest Beauties of both Thought and Expression is rendered
one of the greatest Deformities. Father <em>Bouhours</em>
asserts, that <span class="quotation">Simplicity contributes the most of any Thing
to make a Stile perfect</span>; and again, <span class="quotation">The Holy Scripture,
the Stile of which is, at the same Time, so <em>simple</em> and
so <em>sublime</em></span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Addison</em> has treated of the noble Force of Simplicity
as it relates to Thought; and in the following Verses,
if I am not mistaken, the Simplicity of Expression as
well as Thought is noble:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So chear'd he his fair Spouse, and she was chear'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silently a gentle Tear let fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From either Eye, and wip'd them with her Hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two other precious Drops, that ready stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in their chrystal Sluice, he 'ere they fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kist, as the gracious Signs of sweet Remorse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pious Awe, that fear'd to have offended.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>It is certain, Simplicity, as well as other Virtues in
Speech, has its Vice, and that is Meanness which falls
naturally into Burlesque, as this Line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he will talk&mdash;good gods! How he will talk.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which the <em>Spectator</em> speaks of as inexpressibly beautiful
for its Simplicity, though I think one can hardly repeat
it with a grave Tone; and when I have heard it
pronounced on the Stage in a burlesque Way, as it is in
<em>The Plot and No Plot</em>; it has never fail'd of a hearty
Laugh and Clap. <em>Spectator</em>, N<sup>o</sup> 39. <span class="quotation">There is a Simplicity
in the Words, which out-shines the utmost Pride of
Expression</span>; and he attributes it to the Break, <em>good gods</em>!
He also informs us, that the Thought is at once <em>natural</em>,
<em>soft</em>, <em>passionate</em>, and <em>simple</em>. It would have been well for
us, if the learned Critick had told us in what this Thought
is <em>simple</em>, in what <em>passionate</em>, in what <em>soft</em>, and in what
<em>natural</em>, there being so few Words to express it; and I cannot
help thinking, that it is but one fond Rant of an
amorous Woman. True it is, Simplicity is not of it self
very wordy, but methinks the Break, <em>good gods!</em> has
more of the <em>Passionate</em> in it, than of the <em>Simple</em> or the
<em>Soft</em>; and may be as well used in Anger as in Love, as well
in a Fright as in a Transport. It would have gone a good
Way in explaining the different Kinds of Thought, if the
judicious Author had distinguished them in this Line;
for there are not so many Kinds in one Verse in all Father
<em>Bouhour</em>'s <em>Maniere de bien penser</em>. I would not be
mistaken here, nor be charged with Ostentation, in setting
up my Judgement in Opposition to the <em>Spectator</em>'s;
from whose Writings and Lessons, I have learned more
than from all other Authors. I only offer it as an Instance,
that the Best of our Criticks do not seem to have
gone to the Bottom of this Subject. It never enter'd into
the Heads of Writers and Readers in General, that
Thought was any Thing but Thought, or Stile any Thing
but Stile, or that there were any other Terms or Distinctions
for them, but the Good and the Bad, as is already
hinted; nor were they at all sensible of my Lord <em>Roscommon</em>'s
Meaning in these Verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whose incoherent Stile, like sick Men's Dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Varies all Shapes, and mixes all Extreams.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>The
same may be said of Thought.</p>

<p>I want very much to be informed, whether there is a
perfect Agreement of Thought in these several Quotations
out of <em>Homer</em>, or how they must be understood so
as not to contradict one another. The first Couplet is
against <em>Wine</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Inflaming Wine, pernicious to Mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unnerves the Limbs, and dulls the noble Mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next Couplet is for Wine:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With <em>Thracian</em> Wines recruit thy honour'd Guests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For happy Counsels flow from sober Feasts.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What follows taken out of the <em>Notes</em> upon <em>Homer</em> is
against Wine. <span class="quotation">What <em>Hector</em> says against Wine in the two
first Verses has a great Deal of Truth in it: It is a vulgar
Mistake to imagine the Use of Wine, either raises the Spirits
or encreases Strength.</span></p>

<p>The next Words are for Wine:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then with a plenteous Draught refresh his Soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw new Spirits from the generous Bowl.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again for Wine:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For Strength consists in Spirits and in Blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those are ow'd to generous Wine and Food.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the Translator's Observation, that the moderate
Use of Wine does not raise the Spirits, is not the truer,
because it is said by <em>Hector</em>, the Son of <em>Priam</em>. Father
<em>Sirmond</em>, a sober reverend as well as learned Priest says
quite another Thing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Si bene commemini causæ sint quinque bibendi,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Hospitis Adventus, præsens Sitis, atque futura,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Et Vini bonitas, &amp; quælibet altera Causa.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If all be true, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whoever reads an Author with Exactness cannot fail
of meeting with several Passages, where Self-love, Humour,
Party, or Complexion, are uppermost. Thus a
good Catholick will never have a good Word for a Heretick,
nor a <em>Puritan</em> for a <em>Papist</em>. Dr. <em>Ch&mdash;&mdash;</em> will never
speak well of Punch, nor Dr. <em>Mand&mdash;&mdash;</em> of Watergruel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
He who writes well is jealous of him who judges well, and
he who judges well envies him who writes well. The <em>Swifts</em>
turn every Thing into Grimace, the <em>Whistons</em> into Mathematicks,
and whatever touches an Author's own Taste,
he is always recommending to his Reader.</p>

<p>We all remember how the Duke of <em>Malborough</em> was
treated by the blessed Peace-makers for beating their
Friends the <em>French</em>. <em>Delight in War</em> was a Mark set
upon him in a most solemn Manner, and a memorable
Instance of our Wisdom and Gratitude. There is a Paraphrase
upon it in the Version of <em>Homer</em>; and when the
Application is made will turn the <em>Epick</em> into Satyr.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Curs'd is the Man, and void of Law and Right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unworthy Property, unworthy Light;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That Wretch, that Monster who delights in War;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose Lust is Murder, and whose horrid Joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tear his Country, <em>&amp;c.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To <em>tear</em> a Country is very much in Heroicks. The
Image of <em>Discord</em> has good Lines in it; but methinks
they would not have been the Worse, if they had been
heated a little in <em>Milton</em>'s Furnace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Discord, dire Sister of the slaughtering Pow'r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small at her Birth, <em>but rising ev'ry Hour</em>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While scarce the Skies her horrid Head can bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stalks on Earth, and <em>shapes</em> the World around:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nations bleed, where e'er her Steps she turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Groan still deepens, and the Combat burns.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I refer to the Judgement of the Reader, whether the
following Image of Discord taken from a modern burlesque
Poem, has not more of the Epick in it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Non tulit invisæ speciem Discordia Pacis,</em><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Discord enrag'd at the Approach of Peace<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>The
new invented Words made use of by the Translator
of <em>Homer</em> are well enough chosen, and well warranted
by the Practice of the greatest Poets, such as <em>Moveless</em>,
<em>Instarr'd</em>, <em>Inurn'd</em>, <em>Conglobe</em>, <em>Deathful</em>, <em>Fountful</em>, <em>Lengthful</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if you write of Things abstruse and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words of your own inventing may be us'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i22"><em>Roscom</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have mention'd some of the Helps which were prepared
for the Translator of the <em>Ilias</em>. But Dr. <em>Felton</em> informs
us, Dr. <em>Busby</em> would not allow of Notes; a very
curious Remark That. It is not impossible, but Dr.
<em>Busby</em> himself might have read and taught <em>Homer</em> 50
Years as a <em>Grammarian</em>, without understanding him as
a Poet. A Portion of that Genius which inspir'd the
Author is requisite for the Reader to see all the Beauties
that are in a Poem. I believe the Lord <em>Roscommon</em>'s
Judgement will be preferred to that of both those Doctors:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Search every Comment that your Care can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some here, some there, may hit the Poet's Mind.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the Translator of <em>Homer</em> search'd every Comment,
his Labour was more than <em>Herculean</em>. I own my self
extreamly edify'd by what he says of Antiquaries; applying
a Saying of my Lord <em>Bacon</em>'s to them: <span class="quotation">In General they
write for Ostentation not for Instruction, and their Works
are perpetual Repetitions.</span> The Reason is plain, they
have no Fund of their own, they must therefore borrow
from those that have. It is necessary there should be
such Men, but the Dryness and Barrenness of their Studies
are inconsistent with a lively Fancy and a good Taste;
and I know not which of the Antiquaries deserve most to
be rever'd by us, those that would restore lost Words,
Letters, and Points, or those that would recover lost Fable
or History. To know exactly where <em>Brute</em> built his <em>Palace
Royal</em>, where <em>Bladud</em> set up his <em>Laboratory</em> would be
something; as also to prove, that <em>Cassibelan</em> liv'd where
my Lord <em>Essex</em> now does at <em>Cashiobury</em>; or that <em>Constantine
the Great</em> was a <em>Yorkshire</em> Man; which Things have
been attempted, would be as much to the Glory of the
Students in Antiquity, as to find out a lost <em>Comma</em>, or re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>store
a Letter to a Word that was robb'd of it 1500
Years ago. But as for our Monkish Antiquaries, and the
Monastick Learning, it seems to be reserv'd for the Improvement
of those, whose Minds, like barren Soils, will
never bear without dunging. They are always turning
up the Ruins of old Convents, and hope like the Cock
to find a Jewel in the Dunghill. They dig for holy
Water-Pots and Crucifixes, as greedily as the modern <em>Romans</em>
dig for Medals, Images, and Urns. To know whether
such an Abbey was founded in the Papacy of Pope
<em>Joan</em> or Pope <em>Boniface</em>, in what Dormitory such a Monk
slept, and in what Penitentiary such a Nun was disciplined,
must needs be very edifying. But most of all the
Deciding of historical Debates by old Charters, which,
with a little curious Examination, will be found to be
forged ones. Many of this Kind are printed by <em>Dugdale</em>,
as I shall have Occasion to remark elsewhere. If these
Antiquaries could fix the same Authority on <em>Monkish</em>
Writings, as we are told of <em>Homer</em>'s, that the Claims of
two Cities to certain Limits, were determined by what
he said of them in his <em>Ilias</em>, it would be worth every
one's while to read the Monks instead of the Classicks;
And I doubt not Dr. <em>Felton</em> would have succeeded better
if he had given us Instruction in the Monkish Learning,
than he has done in the <em>Classical</em>. But since their Writings
prove nothing but their Ignorance and Superstition,
I believe Men of Taste and Genius will be so generous as
to leave such hidden Treasures to enrich those, whose
Invention and Judgement lie under the Calamity of the
most extream Poverty. There is nothing but Labour
and Patience requisite to acquire a Mastery in these Studies,
whether the Matter collected be good or bad, 'tis
the same Thing if it be Old, if it be <em>Teutonick</em> or <em>Runick</em>,
<em>Danish</em> or <em>Saxon</em>, that's sufficient. A Man who has
any Warmth in his Imagination, and any Delicacy in his
Taste, cannot be always raking in the Rubbish of barbarous
Ages, and groping in <em>Gothick</em> Darkness. A good
Proof of the small Talent necessary for this Work is, that
there hardly ever was an Author among these Monkish
Antiquaries, but his Language was as barbarous as his
Subject. Such Sort of Scholarship is, I own, very serviceable
to those that know how to make a good Use of
others Labours; but the Merit of the Scholar consists ra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ther
in the Goodness of his Eyes, and the Strength of his
Head, than in the Fineness of his Genius, or the Regularity
of his Judgement. I am apt to think the Translator
of <em>Homer</em> had not the Admirers of these Antiquities
in his Thoughts, but refer'd to the Criticks and Commentators
on the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Roman</em> Authors: For he
says, in another Place, <span class="quotation">To talk of the Genius of an Ancient,
as <em>Macrobius</em> did, is at once the cheapest Way of
shewing our own Taste, and the shortest Way of criticising
the Wit of others</span>. This must be only meant of those
whom Mr. <em>Dryden</em> calls <em>Dutch</em> Commentators, of those
that do by the Classicks, as Correctors of the Press do
by their Copies, and instead of applying themselves to
the Sense stick close to the Letters, and look out for
<em>Dele's</em> and <em>Addenda's</em>. This they call correcting and restoring
the Text; and it is much to be fear'd, that by
this restoring and correcting of the Commentators, and
the Mistakes, Blunders and Negligences of the Copiers,
we have few or no Books of the Antients in their original
Purity and Perfection. However, there is Perfection enough
left in the Classical Writings to prove, That what the
Translator of <em>Homer</em> says, does not relate to the Classicks
themselves, but to those that make an ill Use of them,
and under their Name and Authority insult the Moderns.
The Lord <em>Bacon</em> says somewhere, that what we call the
Antiquity was the Youth of the World, and that we are
properly the Antients as the Inhabitants of an older World,
and having made infinite Improvements in all the most
useful Parts of Learning.</p>

<p>I dare not say, there is a Quibble in the Expression of
so illustrious a Writer, but I must always take the Authors
that wrote 1500 or 2000 Years ago to be the Antients;
and one may very well Question, whether there
was not as much useful Learning lost in twelve or thirteen
Centuries of Barbarism and Ignorance, as has been discover'd,
or rather recovered in two or three of the last Ages.</p>

<p>The Antiquaries the Translator speaks of would do
Wonders, if they would make it out that the Letter sent
to the King of <em>Edessa</em>, and the Passage in <em>Josephus</em>'s
Book XVIII, relating to our Saviour, are genuine, with
several other Particularities, which are much insisted
upon by Ecclesiastical Writers. The <em>Spectator</em> has told
us something too of Antiquity, which wants the Confir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>mation
of the Antiquaries, and that is a Quotation out of
a Manuscript in the <em>Vatican</em> Library, where <em>Longinus</em> is
made to say, <span class="quotation"><em>Paul</em> of <em>Tarsus</em>, the Patron of an Opinion
not fully proved, must be reckon'd among the best <em>Græcian</em>
Orators</span>. This must be a downright Forgery: <em>Longinus</em>
surely knew the <em>Greek</em> Tongue too well, to cry up
the Eloquence of a Writer in it, who, as St. <em>Jerome</em> says,
did not understand <em>Grammar</em>, and mentions the Places
where he err'd, <span class="quotation">Propter Imperitiam Artis Grammaticæ</span>.
See <em>Gregory</em> on the <em>Septuagint</em>. It were to be wished, that
the Ecclesiastical Writers, even of the earliest Centuries,
had suffer'd nothing to escape them that was improbable,
if not incredible. 'Tis also much wanted to have further
Proof of the Ceasing of Oracles at the Nativity of
our Saviour, and that <em>Virgil</em> prophesy'd of it in his fourth
Eclogue. We should be still more oblig'd to them, if
they would prove, that the <em>Sibyl</em>'s Verses are a Prophecy
of the same Thing, which Things are generally asserted
in the Writings of the Ecclesiasticks. As to Oracles <em>Lucian</em>
tells us, Answers were given in his Time, that of the
Emperor <em>Commodus</em> 160 Years after, <em>Juvenal</em> makes their
Ceasing to be only 100 Years after:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Delphis Oracula cessant.</em><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><em>Theodoret</em> writes, that <em>Julian</em> the Apostate received
an Answer from <em>Apollo</em> at <em>Delphos</em>, 300 Years after the
Birth of our Saviour. All which may be seen in Bishop
<em>Potter</em>'s <em>Greek</em> Antiquities, a most excellent Book; and
if we had more such Antiquaries as that learned Prelate's
and Mr. <em>Basil Kennet</em>'s who wrote the Antiquities of <em>Rome</em>,
we might at the same Time improve ourselves both in antient
and polite Learning. These being, I think the two most
valuable Pieces of the Kind in any Language. As the middle
Way is safest in all Things, so as to the Antients to run
them down as <em>Perrault</em> has done, or cry them up as <em>Boileau</em>
is perhaps equally dangerous, and out of the Medium.
Whatever Advantages we have had of the Antients, probably
they had the same of those that preceeded them. This we
know, that the <em>Latins</em> borrow'd as much from the <em>Greeks</em>
as we have borrow'd from them; and it would be no difficult
Matter to prove, that in all the Branches of polite Literature,
the Moderns, particularly the <em>English</em>, have excell'd
the Antients in as many as the Antients excelled them.</p>

Passage of my Lord <em>Bacon</em>'s before cited, gave
Occasion to Monsieur <em>Perrault</em>, to bring in that noble Author
for an Evidence on his Side against the Antients:
But <em>Boileau</em> vindicates him in this Point; and Father <em>Bouhours</em>,
as another Instance of his excellent Judgement,
declares he prefers the Lord Chancellor <em>Bacon</em> before the
most celebrated Names of Antiquity. <em>Rapin</em> calls him
the greatest <em>Genius of England</em>, and he has not more
Glory from his own Countrymen than from the learned
Men in <em>France</em>.</p>

<p>I expect no Quarter from the Dealers in monastick
Learning, in Heraldry, and Genealogy, who generally
doat upon them even to Frenzy. <em>Du Val</em> in his Geography
informs us, that there is a Nation in <em>America</em>, bordering
on the River of the <em>Amazons</em>, where old Women
go off better than young; under a Notion, that the
Knowledge of the One is preferable to the Vigour and
Beauty of the Other. Thus these Men please themselves
more with the Dryness and Gravity of Antiquity, than
with a beautiful Imagination, and the Charms of Eloquence.
I believe their Opinion will not have many Followers,
nor their Example be much imitated. However,
when such an Antiquary as the great <em>Selden</em> appears in
the World, the Instruction it will receive from him, more
than makes amends for the Labour and Time which others
lose in hunting after worthless Manuscripts, forg'd
Charters, and monkish Fables. The learned and polite
Dr. <em>Bathurst</em> of <em>Oxford</em>, wrote an admirable Poem on the
Death of <em>Selden</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So fell the sacred <em>Sibyl</em>, when of Old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspir'd with mere than mortal Breast could hold:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whether to call it Death or Extasy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She silent lies, and now the Nations find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No Oracles, but i' th' Leaves she left behind.<br /></span>

<p><span class="quotation">Selden etant sans Contredit le plus docte des Anglois
moderns.</span> 'Tis said by a <em>Frenchman</em> and a <em>Papist</em>; but as
much as <em>Selden</em> was an Oracle, and a Glory to our Country,
Archbishop <em>Laud</em> his Brethren would have thrust
his learned Head into a Pillory, if they could have come
at him. I don't know whether it was for his History of
<em>Tythes</em> or not; but that would have been hard after he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had been so fully answer'd by Doctors of both Universities;
who, however, were not, <span class="quotation">Les plus Doctes des Anglois
moderns</span>. Judicious Antiquaries ever were, and ever will
be in Esteem. Those that meddle with Things solid and
useful. None of the Pretenders to this Sort of Knowledge,
are more despicable than such as deal in old
Terms and Phrases, who generally affect a Contempt for
those that are in present Use as weak and effeminate.
The Emperor <em>Augustus</em> could not bear these Men, any
more than <em>Punster</em>'s whom he heartily despis'd. The
Spectator, N<sup>o</sup> 470. has with much Pleasantry animadverted
on those Criticks in Readings, and has brought in
the <em>Cotton Library</em>, <em>Aldus</em>, <em>Scaliger</em>, <em>Scioppius</em>, <em>Salmasius</em>,
the elder <em>Stephens</em>, and a Heap of old Manuscripts,
to clear up the Difficulties in certain Lyrick Verses, about
<span class="quotation">a Shape, an Eye, Wit, Charms, <em>Corinna</em> and <em>Belvedera</em></span>.</p>

<p>As scrupulous and as curious as these <em>Antiquaries</em>
would be thought to be, one might fill Volumes with
Examples of the most notorious Mistakes and Blunders
in the Writings of the most learned among them; which
are not taken notice of to lessen the Credit they have worthily
acquir'd, but to shew the Infirmity of humane Nature,
which will always be attended with Errours, and never
arrive at Perfection as we have elsewhere observ'd after
<em>Horace</em>:</p>

<p>But in such Authors, what is good more than atones
for what is not so, and 'tis only where a Writer shews a
Defect in Will as well as Judgement, that he renders
himself blame-worthy, especially in History. Several of
these Blunders are collected by <em>Marville</em> in his <em>Melange</em>,
&amp;c. 'Tis remark'd of <em>Pliny</em>, that in translating <em>Democritus</em>,
he says, the Camelion is like a Crocodile, and altogether
as big&mdash;The <em>Crocodalos</em> of <em>Democritus</em> is in the
<em>Jonick</em> Dialect, a <em>Lizard</em>, which may be about some ten
thousand Times less than a Crocodile, and yet a great
many Times bigger than a <em>Camelion</em>. <em>Eutychius</em> speaking
of <em>Eusebius</em> of <em>Cesarea</em>, sirnamed <em>Pamphilus</em>, calls
him <em>Eusebius</em>, Bishop of the City of <em>Phili</em>. <em>Quintus
Curtius</em> mistakes <em>Arabia Fælix</em> for <em>Arabia Deserta</em>. He
confounds the <em>Euxine</em> with the <em>Caspian</em> Sea, and makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the Rivers <em>Tygris</em> and <em>Euphrates</em> run through <em>Media</em>,
which they never enter'd. Mr. <em>Simon</em>, in his critical History,
takes <em>Suna</em> and <em>Fratela</em>, two Officers of the <em>Gothick</em> Army,
for two <em>German</em> Ladies. The Life of <em>Charlemagne</em>,
written by <em>Acciaioli</em>, having been often joyn'd with <em>Plutarch</em>'s
Lives, was published by <em>Vicellius</em> as written by
<em>Plutarch</em>, who liv'd 6 or 700 Years before <em>Charlemagne</em>.
<em>Gerard Vossius</em> affirms, that the Society of the <em>Sorbonne</em>
was instituted by <em>Robert</em>, Brother of <em>S. Lewis</em> King of
<em>France</em>, instead of <em>Robert</em> sirnamed <em>Sorbonne</em> from the
Place of his Nativity. <em>Pallavicini</em> in his History of the
Council of <em>Trent</em>, says <em>Lansac</em>, the <em>French</em> Ambassador,
was Knight of the Order of the Holy Ghost, which was
not instituted till twenty Years after; but what has particular
Relation to us <em>Englishmen</em> is the Charge against <em>Dodwel</em>:
<span class="quotation">Dodowel dans ses Dissertations sur Saint Cyprien prend
la Ville d'Olympe pour une Olympiade,</span> takes the City
<em>Olympus</em> for an <em>Olympiade</em>, the Name of the Place
where, for the Date of the Year when it was done, which
is Matter of much Humiliation to all such as believe it
impossible for so learned and orthodox a Man to commit so
great an Oversight; and plainly proves to us, that those who
write of what past 1000 or 2000 Years ago, are as likely
to err, as those who write of what past three or fourscore
Years ago. Whoever has a Curiosity to see more of the
<em>Blunderings</em>, which the most learned are charg'd with,
such as the <em>Port Royal</em>, <em>Baronius</em>, <em>Vasquez</em>, <em>Du Cange</em>,
<em>Varillas</em>, <em>L'Abbé</em>, &amp;c. may have full Satisfaction in <em>Marville</em>'s
<em>Melange</em>, <em>p. 208. &amp; seq.</em> taken from a Book written
by <em>Boileau</em>'s Uncle, entituled, <em>Colloquium Criticum de
Sphalmætis viromum in re literaria illustrium</em>. Of what
Size would the Book be, if we should examine with the
same Exactness, <em>Nalson</em>, <em>Heylin</em>, <em>Wharton</em>, <em>Collier</em>,
<em>Dugdale</em>, <em>Brady</em>, the <em>Grand Rebellion</em>, the <em>Histories</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> And collect and publish the Errours, both of
the Will and the Judgement. Nor are these Names by
any Means more illustrious, than those we meet with in
the <em>Colloquium</em>.</p>

<p>The Translator of <em>Homer</em> has an Excuse for Mr. <em>Dryden</em>,
which is much more generous than just: He says,
<span class="quotation">His Haste in Writing ought not to be imputed to him as
a Fault, but to those who suffer'd so noble a Genius to lie
under the Necessity of it.</span> Mr. <em>Dryden</em>'s Genius did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
appear in any Thing more than his <em>Versification</em>; and
whether the Criticks will have it ennobled for that <em>Versification</em>
only, is a Question. The Translator seems to
make a good <em>Genius</em> and a good Ear to be the same
Thing. <em>Dryden</em> himself was more sensible of the Difference
between them, and when it was in Debate at <em>Will</em>'s
Coffee-house, what Character he would have with Posterity;
he said, with a sullen Modesty, <span class="quotation">I believe they will
allow me to be a good Versifier</span>. If we will believe Mr.
<em>Dryden</em>, he did not lie under the Necessity of Haste: In
several of his Dedications and Prefaces, he has declared,
He never wanted. When he renounced his Allegiance to
King <em>William</em>, and disqualified himself for keeping the
Laureat's Place with that of Historiographer, he had
a Pension from the then Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of
<em>Dorset</em>, which was an Instance of Generosity that is rarely
to be met with in the History of <em>Lewis</em> XIV, who
paid more to Poets and Historians than all the Princes of
<em>Europe</em>. His Bounty has been extoll'd, even by those
whom his Bigotry had banish'd, yet he seldom let it extend
to any of the Reformed Religion, let their Merit
be ever so great. Mademoiselle <em>le Fevre</em>, afterwards Madam
<em>Dacier</em>, dedicated a Book to that Prince, and the
Duke <em>de Montausier</em> introduc'd her at Court; but the King
would not accept of the Book, nor admit that his Name
should be put before the Epistle.</p>

<p>The Duke, whose Character had some Bluntness in it,
said, <span class="quotation">Sir, Is this the Way to encourage Learning: The
Lady deserves well of your Majesty and the Publick, and
if you will not reward her your self, suffer me to give her
100 Pistoles, I matter not whether I am paid again</span>: or
Words to that Effect. This Learned Lady was far from
being an Enemy to the Government as <em>Dryden</em> was, and
he did not stick to shew it upon all Occasions, even when
he was pension'd by my Lord Chamberlain. The Truth
is, he was like fond Fathers who can see no Faults in
their Children; and as to his hasty Writing, 'tis pretty
well known that as easy as his Verses appear to be, he
came hard by them: He thought it a good Day's Work
if he could finish 40 Verses a Day; and some learned
<em>Antiquaries</em>, I suppose from a <em>MSS.</em> of <em>Virgil</em>'s Amanuensis,
assure us, that <em>Maro</em> wrote as many, and drawing
them off the <em>Lee</em> afterwards, in his Poetical Limbeck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
reduced them to Ten. <em>Godeau</em>, Bishop of <em>Vence</em>, us'd
to write 2 or 300 Verses a-day. I my self paid a Visit
once to a Verse-maker in an Afternoon, and saw 200
political Verses on his Table, which he told me he had
written since Dinner: By this Dispatch he soon furnish'd
out a <em>Folio</em>. <em>Dryden</em> was so far from spying Blemishes
in his Works, that he often took them for Beauties,
and particularly what the <em>Italians</em> call <em>Concetti</em>.
This noted Rant in the <em>Conq. Gran.</em></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, alone am King of Me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is happily imitated by him in his <em>State of Innocence</em>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I my self am proud of Me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to criticise on <em>Dryden</em>'s Prefaces and Plays is a much
greater Labour than to copy them all over, and equally
ungenerous and impertinent: If any one will compare
his <em>Fall of Man</em> with <em>Milton</em>'s Paradise lost, he will
quickly perceive to which of them it is that the <em>noble
Genius</em> is to be apply'd; and if it belongs to <em>Milton</em>, some
other Epithet should be thought of for <em>Dryden</em>.</p>

<p>I have already observ'd, that I did not intend to form
a regular Discourse, and I think I have kept pretty well
to my Intention: If the Reader misses any Thing of
Instruction by it, he will find it made up in Entertainment.
The Variety will excuse the Want of Method in
a Subject not so capable of it as where the Matter is
certain and well known. I wish I were able to give Examples
of all Father <em>Bouhour</em>'s several Kinds of
Thoughts out of <em>English</em> Authors, but Examples are
much nicer Work than Precepts. Every one may agree
that a Thing ought to be so done, but saw that it is so
done. Men's Idea's of the same Things, vary in the Reflection
as much as their Views do in Prospect, according
to the Light they appear in. Dr. <em>Felton</em> makes a Trifle
of it in one Part of his Preface, and an insuperable Difficulty
in another. <span class="quotation">I might, at once, with the Trouble only
of Transcribing, have adorn'd the Work, and diverted the
Reader.</span> Contrary to this, he says, <span class="quotation">If any Body is pleas'd
to try, he will hardly find it practicable to illustrate these
Rules by Examples.</span> The Quotations, which he had be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>fore
term'd transcribing only, are not so easy as he imagin'd
to be done with Beauty and Judgement, was
he sure of writing out nothing but what was as much
to the Purpose as if it had been made for it, otherwise
he might have transcrib'd puffy Thoughts for sublime,
trifling Thoughts for pretty, affected Thoughts for
agreeable; in short, false Thoughts for fine ones, and I
am afraid that would have been his Misfortune, had he
attempted it. In his Preface he blames <em>Tully</em> for quoting
himself, and <em>Aristotle</em> for being dry; but as he has
not gone much beyond the Latter in his Criticisms, nor
the Former in his Eloquence, so I believe their Reputation
will not be much the worse for him, and it had been
better if the Doctor had follow'd the Direction of <em>Quintillian</em>,
<span class="quotation"><em>Modesto tamen &amp; Circumspecto judicio</em>, &amp;c. People
should speak with a great deal of Modesty and Circumspection
of such great Men, for it may happen, as it
very often does, that they condemn what they do not understand.</span></p>

<p>I am apprehensive enough that this Undertaking will
be censur'd as an Effect of Vanity and Arrogance, and I
am well enough acquainted with the Spirit of the People
I have to deal with,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Genus irritabile Vatum.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I please my self with the Reflection, that I have
not mingled the least Spice of Malice in the Composition,
as it relates to Criticism, and am so far from being vain
and arrogant, that I frequently and sincerely declare, my
chief Design was to excite some more capable Writer to do
what I knew my self uncapable of; and if any such Person
shall, by exposing my Errours, give the World a true
Light, I will not only gratefully follow it, but rejoyce at
it, and take hold or the Opportunity to have my Share
of the Instruction, if it comes from clean Hands, and is
not defil'd with ill Manners and ill Language: Such tutoring
I shall despise, and it being very common for Authors
to have as good an Opinion of themselves as of any
Body else, I shall not think any Name of Authority
enough to justify either Insolence or Scurrility. About
40 Years ago there was a Student at <em>Oxford</em>, who acquir'd
a good Hand at a Fiddle; but, falling afterwards
into Melancholy, he grew averse to Musick, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
not be prevail'd upon by his Friends to touch it: They
had but one Way to excite him to it, and that was for
some unskilful Hand to take his Violin and scrape upon it;
he would then immediately snatch it away from him,
and, in a Kind of Resentment, give it the utmost Elegance
of Sound and Harmony. I freely own I had this
Man's Example in my Head when I began this Essay,
and should the Success be the same, the End of it is
answer'd.</p>

<p>I cannot close this Essay without taking Notice of the
Perverseness of Men, who pretend to Wit and Judgement,
towards one another: It appears mostly in Pretenders,
and is very well markt by <em>Boileau</em>, in these two
Verses translated by Mr. <em>Dennis</em>, and equal to the
Original:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus one Fool lolls his Tongue out at another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shakes his empty Noddle at his Brother.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was not so when Judgement and Wit were something
more than Pretence only, when they were in the Heighth
of Excellence, under the Patronage of <em>Augustus</em>. My
Lord <em>Roscommon</em>, in his Preface to <em>Horace</em>'s Art of Poetry
writes thus: <span class="quotation">I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but
if I durst, I would beg them to remember, that <em>Horace</em>
ow'd his Favour and his Fortune to the Character given
of him by <em>Virgil</em> and <em>Varius</em>; that <em>Fundanius</em> and <em>Pollio</em>
are still valued by what <em>Horace</em> say of them, and that in
that Golden Age there was a good Understanding among
the Ingenious; and those who were the most esteem'd were
the best natur'd.</span> <em>Dryden</em> has made the same Observation:
<span class="quotation">Certainly, the Poets of <em>Ovid</em>'s Age enjoy'd much
Happiness in the Conversation and Friendship of one another.</span>
<span class="quotation">The antient Criticks</span>, says the <em>Spectator</em>, <span class="quotation">are full
of the Praises of their Contemporaries. They discover
Beauties which escap'd the Observation of the Vulgar,
and very often find out Reasons for palliating and excusing
such Slips and Oversights, as were committed in the Writings
of eminent Authors.</span> Mr. <em>Addison</em> has imitated them
in his Remarks upon <em>Milton</em>'s <em>Paradice Lost</em>; but it must
be allowed that the Task was made very easy, and the
Beauties shine so brightly, that there's no taking one's Eye
off of them. It has also been wish'd, that the two or three
Slips in Expression which he quotes out of <em>Milton</em> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
been excused, as they might have been by observing,
that if there's a Pun in the <em>Paradice Lost</em>, 'tis the Devil
that makes it.</p>

<p>One of the surest Signs, that the Wits of the past and
present Age, <em>English</em> and <em>French</em>, are not of the Size of
those of the Age of <em>Augustus</em>, is their Jealousies and Broils.
The <em>Spectator</em> has this Remark, N<sup>o</sup> 409; <span class="quotation">I cannot think,
that <em>Corneille</em>, <em>Racine</em>, <em>Moliere</em>, <em>Boileau</em>, <em>La Fontaine</em>,
<em>Bruyere</em>, <em>Bossu</em>, or the <em>Dacier</em>'s, would have written so
well as they did, had they not been Friends and Contemporaries.</span>
'Tis said very much in Favour of good Nature,
and therefore is very agreeable: But I Question, whether
Emulation, and sometimes even Resentment, may not produce
very good Effects in the Works of the Ingenious.
<em>Facit Indignatio versus.</em> <em>Godeau</em>, <em>Vaugelas</em>, <em>Malherbe</em>,
were Men of great Merit; and so were also, <em>Maynard</em>,
<em>La Mothe Le Vayer</em>, and <em>Costar</em>; yet they wrote against one
another with some Acrimony.</p>

<p>'Tis Envy and Spleen, that produce a Set of Writers
in <em>England</em>, call'd <em>Answerers</em>, whose Modesty may be
conceived by some of their Titles, <em>The best Answer that
ever was.</em> Part 1st. <em>The best Answer that ever was.</em>
Part the 2d. <em>A better Answer</em> than the <em>best Answer</em>. The
<em>Unanswerable Answer</em>, by <em>Lesley</em> and others. You can't
publish a <em>Pamphlet</em> or <em>Essay</em>, but it is immediately snapt
at to be answer'd: Nay, Dr. <em>Halley</em>'s Calculation of the
Eclipse in a Half-sheet had two or three <em>political</em> Answers.</p>

<p>The Itch of Answering is so great, that some Authors
have taken it in Dudgeon, not to have been thought
worthy of an Answer; and to prevent such Disgrace a
second Time, have written on Purpose that they might
answer themselves. I have heard, that the learned and
ingenious <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> is in the Number of these.</p>

<p>How can it be expected, that Men of Passions, worldly
Minds, and Lay-men should escape this Infection, when
the Fathers themselves in the first Ages of the <em>Church</em>,
could not help writing against one another, with as much
Sharpness as any modern Writers. St. <em>Jerom</em>, in Particular,
is charg'd with this Weakness, in his Writings against <em>Lactantius</em>,
St. <em>Ambrose</em>, St. <em>Hilary</em>, <em>Didymus</em>. 'Tis said,
that <span class="quotation">he spar'd neither Antients nor Moderns</span>; no not
the inspir'd Elders that translated the Septuagint: Himself
having translated the Bible into <em>Latin</em>, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
seem'd to be as fond of his Works as are other Translators.</p>

<p>Our Neighbours, the <em>French</em>, have not been altogether
free from this Humour of <em>Answering</em>, or rather writing
against one another; as will appear by the following List
of a dozen Authors of a Side; most of them of the
<em>French</em> Academy; and I might name as many more of
equal Rank:</p>

<p>As the most delicate Praise is that which has the
<em>Face</em> of Satyr, so the most delicate Satyr is that which
has the Face of Praise. Of the latter Kind are the
Verses to the honourable <em>Edward Howard</em> on his <em>incomparable</em>
and <em>incomprehensible</em> Play. Those Verses were
written by the Duke of <em>Buckingham</em>, the Lord <em>Dorset</em>,
Mr. <em>Waller</em>, and others. Of the former Kind are several
of <em>Voiture</em>'s Letters to the Prince of <em>Conde</em>, and <em>Boileau</em>'s
to the Duke <em>de Vivonne</em> in Imitation of them. Indeed
we must allow, that the <em>French</em> do understand the
<em>Belle Raillerie</em> better than we do, at least for the Generality,
there being some Authors in <em>English</em>, that have
succeeded in fine Raillery as well as the <em>French</em>. Thus
did Archbishop <em>Tillotson</em> treat <em>Sergeant</em> the <em>Popish</em> Priest:
Thus Bishop <em>Sprat</em> handled <em>Sorbiere</em>; and Dr. <em>Burnet</em> of
the Charter-house treated one <em>Warren</em> who had attack'd
his <em>Theory</em>. If our Answerers could write as they did,
they would both divert and instruct us. But we have already
explained what they mean by Raillery. They
know not how to parry like good Fencers, and therefore
knock down like Cudgel Players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>The
last Word puts me in Mind of a lower Order of
Criticks, which are rarely heard of within the Sound of
<em>Bow-Bell</em>; and these are your <em>Etymologists</em> and your <em>Orthographists</em>,
who turn to <em>Rider</em> or <em>Holy Oak</em> for the Derivation
of Words, and have the learned <em>Garretson</em> and
other Helps for Spelling: But I know not whether this
Essay may travel far enough into the Country to be of any
Use; and besides, I have not converst enough with
those Criticks that deal in Words and Letters only, to be
Master of the Subject, which is generally learn'd by such
as make a Penny of it in Conversation by laying Wagers,
the Power and Test of all rural Argument.</p>

<p>I must own the <em>Etymologists</em> are by much the greater
Men of the Two than the <em>Orthographists</em>. I do affirm
this, not only because it is necessary to know the Roots of
Languages, but because it is a greater Mark of Scholarship,
and has the Sanction of the most learned Universities.
The profoundest of our own Antiquaries have, in
Favour of the University of <em>Oxford</em>, found out an Etymology,
that may match with the famous One of <em>Diaper
Napkin</em>: From whence comes King <em>Pepin</em>. Bishop <em>Stillingfleet</em>
informs us, that the Champions for the Antiquity
of <em>Oxford</em> say, that the old Name is <em>British</em>, and it is
read somewhere <em>Iren</em> which should be read <em>Icen</em>, and that
again <em>Ychen</em>, and that <em>Rydychen</em>, and <em>Rydychen</em> in the
<em>British</em> Tongue is <em>Vadum Boum</em> in <em>Latin</em>, and that in
<em>English</em>, <em>Oxenford</em>, <em>Oxford</em>, and <em>Oxon.</em> Such wonderful
Discoveries are made by the venerable Antiquaries. <em>Iren</em>
runs the Gauntlet through three Languages <em>Irish</em>, <em>Welsh</em>,
and <em>Latin</em>, before it drops into <em>English</em>, but considering
there is more <em>Greek</em> in the <em>Welsh</em> Tongue than there is
<em>Latin</em>, it may make Work for great Scholars, to shew
their Scholarship in settling the Matter as it should be
with a Salvo for the Rights of the University of <em>Cambridge</em>.</p>

<p>The Learned in <em>France</em> have an Etymology almost as
good as that of <em>Oxford</em> from <em>Iren</em>, which is the Word
<em>Cemetiere</em> a Church-yard; They derive it from the <em>Latin</em>
Word <em>cum</em> with, and <em>mittere</em> to put, as much as to
say the dead Bodies are put together in one burying
Place. Thus the Boxes at the <em>Opera</em> are a <em>Cemetiere</em> or
Church-yard, because the Ladies and Gentlemen are
put with one another there, and thus by Virtue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
same Etymology, the Place where People are born and
where they are bury'd are all one, from <em>Cum</em> with, and
<em>Mittere</em> to put, as I have heard, that the same Word
serves for Life and Death in one of the oriental Languages.</p>

<p>As to <em>Orthography</em>, the only Passage I have read in a
polite Author concerning it is that of <em>Boileau</em>, who taxes
<em>Perrault</em> with false Spelling, by putting an <em>s</em> in one Word,
and leaving out an <em>s</em> in another. By putting an <em>s</em> into
the Word <em>Contemples</em>, it lost the Imperative Mood which
is <em>Contemple</em>; and by leaving out an <em>s</em> in the Word <em>Casuiste</em>,
written <em>Casuite</em>, it became no Word at all. When Moods
and Tenses, Numbers and Cases, Substantives and Adjectives,
suffer by <em>Orthography</em>, the curious Country-man
has reason to cry out, otherwise the Printer may
be answerable for the Spelling.</p>

<p>After all that has been said of the <em>Sublime, &amp;c.</em> perhaps
the Criticks do make more of Things than is necessary,
or in Nature: Tho' Poets pretend to Inspiration,
and cry out, <span class="quotation">The god, the god</span>, they are, in the
Main, but meer Men, and have their Tricks and Quirks
to keep up the Reputation of that Art: Nay, like other
Professions, they would have us believe, that there's Mystery
in it too; not, I suppose, as Divines understand it,
but in the vulgar Sense, as it is understood when we say,
the Trade or Mystery of a <em>Cordwainer</em>. Some of these
Poetical Mysteries are as follow.</p>

<p>We are told that this Verse of <em>Homer</em>'s Third <em>Iliad</em>
was said, by <em>Alexander the Great</em>, to be the best in all
the Poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great in the Wars, and great in Arts of Sway.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Methinks our <em>Gazette</em> Men, and <em>Courant</em> Men, express
themselves every whit as well, when in Honour of a defunct
General, whose Activity had long furnish'd them
with Matter for their News-Books, they tell us, He was
great alike in the Camp, and in the Cabinet, which easily
runs into as good a Verse as the other.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great in the Camp, and in the Cabinet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next best Verses that ever were, are <em>Boileaus</em>; and
they were said to be the best in all his Works, by <em>La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Fontaine</em>: The Subject is the <em>French</em> King's setting up
Lace-making at <em>Roan</em>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Et nos voisins frustrez de ces tributs serviles,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Que paiat a leur Art, le Luxe de nos Villes.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more by foreign Tributes are we griev'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, from our Luxury, alien Arts receiv'd.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why these are better Verses than all other best Verses,
is the Mystery we are speaking of, and like that of the
Free-Masons, it cannot be unfolded but by a Brother;
nay, one may suspect of this Mystery what is justly suspected
of that; they do not tell it us, for fear we shou'd
laugh at it.</p>

<p>Of this Kind, doubtless, is the famous Couplet, taken
out of Sir <em>John Denham</em>'s <em>Coopers-Hill</em>, which <em>Dryden</em>
says, are the two best Verses in the <em>English</em> Tongue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' Deep, yet clear; tho' Gentle, yet not dull;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong without Rage, without o'erflowing full.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He said he would not reveal the Secret why they were
the best Verses, but left it as a Riddle to Posterity. I
dare say, there are a Thousand as good Verses in
Mr. <em>Pope</em>'s <em>Homer</em>, if by good Verses he means smooth
ones, and one would think Three such Monysyllables
as <em>Yet</em>, <em>Not</em>, <em>Dull</em>, all together, was enough to set aside
the Claim of that Line.</p>

<p>Having said so much already of my honest Intention
In this <em>Essay</em>, I must, at last, refer it to the Judgement
of the Reader, and whatever it is, shall receive it with
Pleasure, when it is given with Candour.</p>

<p>If he approves of what I have said, I cannot but be
pleased with having given some few Hints to another.</p>

<p>If he does not approve of it, 'twill please me still more
to receive new Light my self.</p>

<p>Since this Essay was finish'd, I have seen a Book
written by a <em>French</em> Gentleman, which has been
receiv'd with much Civility; and as that Gentleman
is commanded to make Remarks on our Manners
in <em>England</em>, he will not do us Justice unless he puts the
Reception his Book has met with, among the Instances
of our Humanity to Strangers.</p>

<p>I must own I have not learnt a good deal by it, and
the Reading of it has not excited any Impatience in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to read any new <em>Heroick</em> Poem. I have long despair'd to
see another good <em>Dramatick</em>, and much more an <em>Epick</em>
Poem in <em>English</em>, and cannot hope now to see one in
<em>French</em>, which never yet was seen: However, I wish so
well to all such generous Enterprizes, that I think it
barbarous to give them the least Discouragement.</p>

<p>My Objections to this Gentleman's Criticisms are for
what he says too ill of <em>Milton</em>'s Poem, and too good of
<em>Clarendon</em>'s History, which he highly commends for the
fine Characters, tho' he seems not to understand them, or
not to have inform'd himself sufficiently of the Facts on
which they are founded. He assures us the Lord <em>Clarendon</em>
has <span class="quotation">unravell'd all the Springs of the Civil Wars</span>.
I pass by the Expression to <em>unravel a Spring</em>, for that
probably it sounds better in the <em>French</em> Idiom than in
the <em>English</em>: But the Sense of it is not true in Fact.
<span class="quotation">He has drawn, at full Length, the pictures of those whose
Ambition shook the Foundation of his Country.</span> He has
drawn them at full Length indeed, but as <em>Milton</em>
drew his shadowy Beings, <em>Death</em>, <em>Sin</em>, <em>Chaos</em>, by the
Extent of his Imagination, and with little Regard to
Historical Likeness, or copying after Nature; his Pictures
on the King's Side being to a Man, all so many
Heroes; on that of the Parliament so many <em>Scoundrels</em>;
which was impossible to be true: For, besides that it
was not in the Course, so it was not in the Nature of the
Thing, that so many heroical Persons should take Party
for Oppression and Superstition, and so many Blockheads
and Poltrons espouse the Cause of Religion and
Liberty.</p>

<p>But I do not wonder that this Critick is so extreamly
civil to the Author of the <em>History of the Rebellion</em>. He
censures <em>Milton</em> for drawing the Pictures of <em>Death</em> and
the <em>Devil</em> with so much Deformity. <em>Satan</em>, <em>Sin</em>, and
<em>Death</em>, must needs <span class="quotation">shock the Readers of a delicate Taste</span>.
As if it was possible for the Imagination to paint any
Thing so ugly as the Devil is in every One's Conception,
and that the more shocking such Painting is, it was not
the more natural, as being the more conformable to the
Idea which every one has conceiv'd of the Original. 'Tis
true, the <em>Devil</em> and <em>Death</em> are not Subjects to touch the
<em>Delicacy</em> of Readers, but are extreamly proper to move
Horrour and Detestation, which are there the Moral of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
that Divine Poem. If the Scene of <em>Paradise</em> was opening,
the Reader might have expected something to have
touch'd his <em>Delicacy</em>; but when he came, as in <em>Milton</em>,
to the Gates of Hell <em>wide open</em>, he certainly should have
left his Delicacy behind him. <em>Hans Holben</em>'s Death's
Dance is a merry Piece, but was no more proper to admit
of Delicacy than the Droll Pieces of <em>Heemskirk</em>; and
it would not be more extravagant to put Perfumes among
the Ingredients of a <em>Stink-Pot</em>, than to put Delicacy in
a Picture of the Devil. One of the most masterly Pieces
of the greatest Matter of the <em>Lombard</em> School, a Carcass on
a Butcher's Stall with the Gutts and Garbage about it,
was much admir'd by the <em>Italians</em>, whose Delicacy is
exemplary to other Nations; whence one may conclude,
that whatever Subject has Truth and Likeness in it according
to Nature, or our Conception of it, will always
please, as an exact: and lively Imitation. I shall take
no more Notice of the Criticisms on <em>Milton</em> in this
Place, nor perhaps in any other; but I can never read
the Remarks of the Criticks on the <em>Paradise Lost</em>,
without calling to Mind the Boast of King <em>Alphonso</em>,
who criticising on the Form of the <em>Creation</em>, said, <span class="quotation">If
he had been consulted in it, it should have been more
perfect.</span></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
